NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd.  Environmental and Socio-Economic Assessment 
Liege Lateral Loop 2 – Thornbury Section Pipeline and 
the Leismer East Compressor Station Project 

September 2014 / 496955/492475 

 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL), a wholly owned subsidiary of TransCanada PipeLines Limited is 
proposing to construct and operate the Liege Lateral Loop 2 – Thornbury Section Pipeline and the Leismer 
East Compressor Station (the Project). The Project will be part of the NGTL System, a network of 24,400 km 
of pipeline that transports natural gas for use within Alberta and British Columbia and for delivery to other 
markets across North America. The Project is located in the Regional Municipality (RM) of Wood Buffalo 
and Lac La Biche County in the Green Area of Alberta. The pipeline route will parallel the existing NGTL 
Liege Lateral and Liege Lateral Loop.  

The pipeline component of the Project will involve looping the existing natural gas transmission system to 
transport natural gas from the existing Pelican Lake Compressor Station at NW 29-81-16 W4M (KP 36.3) 
and travel east across Highway 63 to tie into the proposed Leismer East Compressor Station located at 
NE 33-80-13 W4M (KP 0) (Figure 1). The pipeline is approximately 36 km in length of 762 mm O.D. 
(NPS 30) pipeline, with a maximum allowable operating pressure of 9,930 kPa. The pipeline will be 
constructed parallel to existing rights-of-way (i.e., pipelines, access roads and seismic lines) for 
approximately 28 km (77%) of the proposed route except where minor deviations are warranted (e.g., to 
facilitate crossing existing infrastructure or watercourses). The Project will include the construction of the 
proposed Leismer East Compressor Station at NE 33-80-13 W4M to connect the Liege Lateral Loop 2 to 
the existing Leismer-Kettle River Crossover. The proposed Leismer East Compressor Station is a greenfield 
(new) 15MW compressor station comprising of a new turbo-compressor package, auxiliary buildings and 
equipment. These buildings and equipment include, but are not limited to, a compressor building, yard 
piping and electrical systems. 

Known reference points along the route, referred to as KPs, are approximately 1 km apart and are primarily 
used to describe features along the pipeline route for construction, operations and maintenance purposes. 
Project construction will occur from east to west, starting at KP 0 with completion at KP 36.3. 

The typical pipeline construction right-of-way will be 32 m wide. Additional areas for temporary workspace 
of varying width at select locations along the entire construction right-of-way length will be required to 
accommodate construction activities (i.e., log decks, staging areas and material and pipe stockpile sites). 
Where feasible, existing highways and roads and the proposed right-of-way will be used to access the 
Project. One new permanent access road is required to support construction and operations of the 
proposed Leismer East Compressor Station.  

NGTL commissioned TERA, a CH2M HILL Company (TERA) to prepare an Environmental and 
Socio-Economic Assessment (ESA) to satisfy the requirements under Section 58 of the National Energy 
Board (NEB) Act for approval of this Project. Subject to regulatory approvals, clearing of the compressor 
station and access road is scheduled to commence in May 2015 with pipeline activities expected to begin 
in September 2015. The Project is expected to be commissioned and operational by April 2016. 

The following field surveys and desktop assessments were conducted to support the ESA and inform the 
Environmental Protection Plan (EPP) (Appendix 1) as well as the Environmental Alignment Sheets 
(Appendix 2): a fish technical report (Appendix 3); an air quality and greenhouse gas assessment 
(Appendix 4); a noise impact assessment (Appendix 5); a wetland evaluation (Appendix 6); a vegetation 
report (Appendix 7); and a wildlife report (Appendix 8); the Alberta Culture Historical Resources Act 
Approval and Requirements (Appendix 9) as well as a Traditional Knowledge report (Appendix 10) were 
also completed.  

The Project is located in a forested setting within the RM of Wood Buffalo and Lac La Biche County, 
Municipal District (Lac La Biche). All of the lands traversed by the pipeline routes are Crown-owned and lie 
within the Green Area of Alberta. The nearest community to the proposed pipeline route is the 
Unincorporated Community of Mariana Lake (approximately 3 km southwest), while the nearest community 
with full services is the City of Fort McMurray, approximately 95 km northeast. The pipeline crosses two 
fish-bearing drainages, six nonfish-bearing drainages, five unnamed tributaries to Dropoff Creek, Dropoff 
Creek, an unnamed tributary to House River, and finally, the House River. In addition, the Project crosses 
11 treed fens, 1 shrubby fen, 4 mixedwood treed swamps, 3 shrubby swamps and 1 seasonal emergent 
marsh. The Project crosses a Leading Edge Mountain Pine Beetle (MPB) Management Zone and a Key

Wildlife and Biodiversity Zone (KWBZ) associated with the House River. Additionally, the Project is located 
within the East Side of Athabasca River Caribou Range. 

Potential environmental concerns identified by this ESA include: issues relating to soil erosion control; 
potential effects on downstream water quality; potential alteration of wetland function; potential introduction 
and spread of weeds; incremental alteration of remnant native vegetation; potential effects on wildlife; and 
potential interference with other land users. Watercourse and wetland crossings have been located and 
construction of the crossings has been planned in a manner which will reduce bank and slope instability as 
well as the potential for future erosion. Specific environmental measures have been identified for 
watercourse and wetland crossing construction as well as strippings handling. These measures, along with 
other protection measures designed to mitigate the potential environmental effects, are identified in the 
EPP within Appendix 1 and on the Environmental Alignment Sheets within Appendix 2. 

The environmental effects associated with the Project are those that are routinely encountered during 
pipeline construction in a forested setting. The application of mitigation measures through a comprehensive 
environmental compliance strategy (environmental protection planning, environmental inspection and 
post-construction monitoring) will avoid, eliminate and/or reduce the severity of potential Project-related 
adverse environmental and socio-economic effects. With the exception of potential effects and cumulative 
effects to woodland caribou and the subsequent traditional use related to woodland caribou, the potential 
adverse residual effects and cumulative effects that may result from the Project are anticipated to be not 
significant.

Liege Lateral Loop 2 – Thornbury Section Pipeline and 
the Leismer East Compressor Station Project 

September 2014 / 496955/492475 

 
1.0 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Overview 

NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL), a wholly owned subsidiary of TransCanada PipeLines Limited 
(TransCanada) is proposing to construct and operate the Liege Lateral Loop 2 – Thornbury Section Pipeline 
and the Leismer East Compressor Station (the Project). The Project will be part of the NGTL System, a 
network of 24,400 km of pipeline that transports natural gas for use within Alberta and British Columbia and 
for delivery to other markets across North America. The Project is located in the Regional Municipality (RM) 
of Wood Buffalo and Lac La Biche County in the Green Area of Alberta. The pipeline route will parallel the 
existing NGTL Liege Lateral and Liege Lateral Loop.  

The pipeline component of the Project will involve looping the existing natural gas transmission system to 
transport natural gas from the existing Pelican Lake Compressor Station at NW 29-81-16 W4M (KP 36.3) 
and travel east across Highway 63 to tie into the proposed Leismer East Compressor Station located at 
NE 33-80-13 W4M (KP 0) (Figure 1). The pipeline is approximately 36 km in length of 762 mm O.D. (NPS 
30) pipeline, with a maximum allowable operating pressure of 9,930 kPa. The pipeline will be constructed 
parallel to existing rights-of-way (i.e., pipelines, access roads and seismic lines) for approximately 28 km 
(77%) of the proposed route except where minor deviations are warranted (e.g., to facilitate crossing 
existing infrastructure or watercourses). The Project will include the construction of the proposed Leismer 
East Compressor Station at NE 33-80-13 W4M to connect the Liege Lateral Loop 2 to the existing 
Leismer-Kettle River Crossover. The Leismer East Compressor Station is a greenfield (new) 15MW 
compressor station comprising of a new turbo-compressor package, auxiliary buildings and equipment. 
These buildings and equipment include, but are not limited to, a compressor building, yard piping and 
electrical systems. 

Known reference points along the route, referred to as KPs, are approximately 1 km apart and are primarily 
used to describe features along the pipeline route for construction, operations and maintenance purposes. 
Project construction will occur from east to west, starting at KP 0 with completion at KP 36.3. 

The typical pipeline construction right-of-way will be 32 m wide. Additional areas for temporary workspace 
of varying width at select locations along the entire construction right-of-way length will be required to 
accommodate construction activities (i.e., log decks, staging areas and material and pipe stockpile sites). 
Where feasible, existing highways and roads and the proposed right-of-way will be used to access the 
Project. One new permanent access road is required to support construction and operations of the 
proposed Leismer East Compressor Station.  

NGTL commissioned TERA, a CH2M HILL Company (TERA) to prepare an Environmental and 
Socio-Economic Assessment (ESA) to satisfy the requirements under Section 58 of the National Energy 
Board (NEB) Act for approval of this Project. Subject to regulatory approvals, clearing of the compressor 
station and access road is scheduled to commence in May 2015 with pipeline activities expected to begin 
in September 2015. The Project is expected to be commissioned and operational by April 2016. 

Pursuant to Guide A.2.1 of the NEB Filing Manual, the level of detail contained in this report corresponds 
to the nature and magnitude of the anticipated environmental impacts and has been prepared to meet NEB 
requirements for a Section 58 Application. An ESA checklist of the NEB Filing Manual requirements is 
provided in Section 1.7. In addition, the ESA has been prepared to meet the requirements of the NEB 
Online Application System (OAS) guidance. 

The Project is located in a forested setting within the RM of Wood Buffalo and Lac La Biche County. All 
lands traversed by the pipeline route are Crown-owned within the Green Area of Alberta. The nearest 
community to the proposed pipeline route is the Unincorporated Community of Mariana Lake 
(approximately 3 km southwest), while the nearest community with full services is the City of Fort McMurray, 
approximately 95 km northeast.  The pipeline route crosses eight watercourses including House River and 
Dropoff Creek. The Project crosses a Leading Edge Mountain Pine Beetle (MPB) Management Zone and 
a Key Wildlife and Biodiversity Zone (KWBZ) associated with the House River, and is located within the 
East Side of Athabasca River [ESAR] Caribou Range (Alberta Sustainable Resource Development [ASRD] 
2011a, Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development [AESRD] 2012a, 2014a).

the Leismer East Compressor Station Project 

September 2014 / 496955/492475 

 
A number of field surveys (i.e., aquatics, wetlands, wildlife, and Traditional Land Use [TLU] studies) were 
conducted along the pipeline route during summer 2013 and winter 2013/2014. Additional aquatic and 
wetland surveys were conducted in May 2014. Vegetation field studies were completed in the summer of 
2014.  

• A fish technical report (Appendix 3) was prepared for the Project which includes the results of an open 
water aquatic assessment conducted by TERA from July 11 to 15 and August 31, 2013 and on May 6, 
2014 along the entire route. The TERA field crew was joined by participants from Christina River Dene 
Nation Council, Saddle Lake Cree Nation and Willow Lake Métis Local No. 780 who contributed their 
knowledge of the area and assisted in the aquatic assessment. There were two fish-bearing drainages, 
six nonfish-bearing drainages and eight proposed watercourse crossings identified along the route: five 
unnamed tributaries to Dropoff Creek; Dropoff Creek; an unnamed tributary to House River; and finally, 
the House River. No additional open water aquatic assessments are planned for the Project. 

• An air quality and greenhouse gas (GHG) assessment (Appendix 4) was prepared by RWDI Consulting 
Engineers & Scientists (RWDI) who were retained by TERA to perform an air quality assessment and 
GHG emissions estimation associated with the construction and operations of the Project. The results 
of the air dispersion modelling indicated that the maximum predicted NO2 and PM2.5 cumulative 
concentrations were less than their corresponding ambient air quality objectives for all averaging 
periods. Project operations-related annual GHG emissions are expected to result in 0.04% and 0.01% 
increases relative to Alberta and Canada’s GHG emissions, respectively. No additional air quality 
assessments are scheduled for the Project.  

• A noise impact assessment (Appendix 5) was prepared by RWDI which includes the results of a field 
noise monitoring program conducted on June 5 and 6, 2014 to measure the existing noise contributions 
in the area and to address the cumulative noise levels with the proposed Project contributions. The 
results indicate that the Project will comply with Directive 038 Permissible Sound Levels (PSLs) and 
found that the Project will be in compliance with daytime and nighttime of 50 and 40 dBA PSLs 
mandated by Directive 038 at the study area boundary. No additional noise assessments are 
anticipated for the Project.  

• A wetland evaluation (Appendix 6) was prepared which includes the results of a helicopter 
reconnaissance and a ground-based wetland assessment on June 4, 2013 and on May 6, 2014. There 
are 21 segments of wetland ecosystem identified as being crossed by the pipeline route: 11 treed fens, 
1 shrubby fen, 4 mixedwood treed swamps, 3 shrubby swamps, 1 deep marsh and 1 seasonal 
emergent marsh. It was found that approximately 54.9% of the pipeline route is comprised of wetlands. 
No additional wetland assessments are planned for the Project. 

• A vegetation survey (Appendix 7) was prepared which incorporates the results of desktop/literature 
review and field work (comprised of rare plant survey, bryophyte and lichen collection, and weed survey 
components) conducted from July 23 to 25, 2013 and from July 4 to 9, 2014. No Committee on the 
Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) or Species at Risk Act (SARA)-listed species 
were observed during the surveys. No species designated under the Alberta Wildlife Act were observed 
during the surveys. There were eight rare lichen species, two rare moss species and one rare vascular 
plant species observed during the rare plant surveys. No Prohibited Noxious weeds or symptoms of 
forest pests were observed at this time. No additional vegetation assessments are planned for the 
Project. 

• A wildlife report (Appendix 8) was prepared which incorporates the results of a literature/desktop review 
and field work conducted along the pipeline route from June 19 to 28, 2013 as well as January 16 to 
21, 2014. The field crew was joined by participants from Christina River Dene Nation Council and 
Saddle Lake Cree Nation in June 2013 and again by Fort McMurray First Nation No. 468, Fort 
McMurray Métis Local 1935 and Saddle Lake Cree Nation during the winter track surveys. A number 
of mammal, bird and amphibian species were observed during the June 2013 wildlife field work: 
50 passerines were recorded including the barn swallow and olive-sided flycatcher (SARA Schedule 1 
or COSEWIC-listed). Additionally, adult western toads were observed at two locations, caribou signs 
(tracks) were observed on an existing right-of-way adjacent to the pipeline right-of-way and an active

beaver dam with recent activity was observed. No amphibian breeding activity (i.e., tadpole), was 
observed. No additional wildlife assessments are planned for the Project. 

• A Historical Resources Impact Assessment (HRIA) was conducted by TERA which incorporates the 
results of a site file search and a field reconnaissance (pedestrian and helicopter) conducted from 
September 26 to October 4, 2013. TERA archaeologists were joined by participants from Christina 
River Dene Nation Council, Saddle Lake Cree Nation, Willow Lake Métis Local No. 780, Fort McMurray 
Métis No. 1935 and Fort McMurray First Nation No. 468, who contributed their knowledge of the area 
and assisted in the archaeological assessment. No historical resources were encountered along the 
pipeline route. A palaeontological assessment was also conducted for the Project that did not return 
any features with palaeontological potential. No further work is recommended for the route. The Alberta

NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd.  Environmental and Socio-Economic Assessment 
Liege Lateral Loop 2 – Thornbury Section Pipeline and 
the Leismer East Compressor Station Project 

September 2014 / 496955/492475 

 
1.2 Project Justification 

The Project is required to provide additional natural gas transmission capacity in the Kirby and Cold Lake 
areas to meet firm service requirements which exceed the current capacity in the area.  

1.3 Scope of the Project 

The scope of the Project includes the activities and components required to carry out the Project and allow 
it to proceed (NEB 2014a). This combination of activities and components includes: 

• construction of the proposed Liege Lateral Loop 2 Thornbury Section Pipeline, the 
proposed Leismer East Compressor Station and one permanent access road; 

• the use of existing infrastructure (i.e., rights-of-way, access roads, compressor stations 
[i.e., Pelican Lake Compressor station], valves, construction site office); and 

• the use of temporary workspace (e.g., construction laydown yard, pipe stockpile sites, 
equipment storage and fuel sites). 

1.4 Scope of the Assessment 

Scoping is the process of identifying the physical works and activities to include within the ESA and what 
biophysical and socio-economic elements are likely to be affected. Proper scoping reduces the risk of 
including unimportant or irrelevant information in the assessment or excluding factors that should be 
assessed (NEB 2014a). This environmental assessment takes into account the factors listed in the NEB 
Filing Manual (NEB 2014a), and pertinent issues and concerns identified through regulatory, stakeholder 
and public consultation, and Aboriginal engagement. 

For projects such as this that do not require an environmental assessment under the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment (CEA) Act, 2012, the NEB usually determines the scope of the assessment 
(NEB 2014a). The environmental assessment considers the following factors: 

• the environmental effects of the project, including the environmental effects of 
malfunctions or accidents that may occur in connection with the project and any 
cumulative environmental effects that are likely to result from the project in combination 
with other projects or activities that have been or will be carried out; 

• the significance of the above effects; 

• changes to the project caused by the environment; 

• comments from the public; 

• measures that are technically and economically feasible and that would mitigate any 
significant adverse environmental or socio-economic effects of the project; and 

• any other matter relevant to the assessment, such as the need for the project, that the 
NEB may require. 

The environmental assessment considers the potential effects of the Project on the environment in the 
context of defined spatial and temporal boundaries. These boundaries will vary with the issues and 
environmental elements or interactions to be considered and will reflect: 

• the construction, operations, maintenance and decommissioning or abandonment 
phases of the proposed physical works and physical activities; 

• the natural variation of a population or ecological or socio-economic component;

• the timing of sensitive life cycle phases in relation to the scheduling of the proposed 

physical works and physical activities; 

• the time required for an effect to become evident; 

• the time required for a population or ecological or socio-economic component to recover 
from an effect and return to a pre-effect condition; 

• the area directly affected by proposed physical works and physical activities; and 

• the area in which a population or ecological or socio-economic component functions and 
within which a Project effect may be felt. 

The spatial boundaries considered one or more of the following areas. 

• The Project Footprint (Footprint) is made up of the area directly disturbed by the Project construction 
and clean-up activities, including associated physical works and activities (i.e., permanent right-of-way, 
permanent compressor station and access road, temporary workspace for construction). 

• A Local Study Area (LSA) varies with the environmental and socio-economic element being considered. 
For each element considered, the LSA is established based on the zone of influence (ZOI) within which 
plants, animals and humans are most likely to be affected by Project construction and operations. The 
LSA boundaries are shown in Section 5.0. Detailed discussions regarding the LSA and associated 
rationale are provided in Section 6.0. For social elements (e.g., Human Occupancy and Resource Use 
[HORU]), local potential effects are related to specific communities considered in the socio-economic 
assessment. The communities considered were based on whether there would be direct potential 
effects, such as a physical, social or economic interaction between the Project and the community or 
community residents, and their economic, social or cultural resources and pursuits. Communities 
considered in this ESA are described in Section 5.0 and listed in Table 6.1. 

• A Regional Study Area (RSA) consists of the area extending beyond the LSA boundary and varies with 
the environmental and socio-economic element being considered. For each element considered, a 
separate spatial RSA boundary was established in consideration of the regional effects of the Project 
on the individual element. The RSA is introduced and further rationale for the establishment of the 
Project RSAs for each element is provided in Section 5.0. 

• A Provincial Area extends beyond regional or administrative boundaries, but confined to Alberta 
(e.g., provincial permitting boundaries, etc.). 

• A National Area extends beyond Alberta but confined to Canada. 

• An International Area extends beyond Canada. 

Reconnaissance and detailed field studies, as well as desktop studies, considered a minimum corridor 
width of approximately 100 m centred on the proposed pipeline route, as well as known areas where 
temporary workspace is expected to be necessary. In the event an area of interest was identified (e.g., rare 
plant or wildlife feature such as a beaver complex), field crews expanded their survey, if appropriate and 
where allowed (no greater than the LSA), to identify the extent and distribution of the area of interest and 
ensure a comprehensive assessment of the environmental feature(s) being surveyed. 

The environmental assessment also considered cumulative environmental effects that are likely to result 
from the Project in combination with existing activities and known future developments that have been or 
will be carried out.

NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd.  Environmental and Socio-Economic Assessment 
Liege Lateral Loop 2 – Thornbury Section Pipeline and 
the Leismer East Compressor Station Project 

September 2014 / 496955/492475 

 

2.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
This section describes and identifies the purpose, location, components and general Project phases 
including: construction; testing; clean-up; operations and maintenance; and decommissioning or 
abandonment. Figure 1 (see Section 1.0) provides an overview map of the Project. 

2.1 Project Purpose 

As noted, the Project will provide additional natural gas transmission capacity in the Kirby and Cold Lake 
areas to meet firm service requirements which exceed the current capability of the NGTL system in the 
area. The proposed Liege Lateral Loop 2 – Thornbury Section Pipeline will move natural gas from the 
existing Pelican Lake Compressor Station located at NW 29-81-16 W4M to the proposed Leismer East 
Compressor Station (NE 33-80-13 W4M) where it will connect the Liege Lateral Loop 2 pipeline to the 
recently completed Leismer-Kettle River Crossover. 

2.2 Alternative Means 

Alternative means are the various ways that are technically and economically feasible to implement and 
carry out a project (CEA Agency 2013a). Since only buried pipeline and associated infrastructure (including 
the compressor station) options realistically meet the need and purpose, and no existing pipelines provide 
a feasible alternative for transportation between the various tie-in points, alternative means were sought 
through the routing process.  

The pipeline route was selected to parallel existing rights-of-way for most of its length, except where there 
were constraints from existing industrial dispositions or constructability. Paralleling existing rights-of-way 
allows for a lower Project impact for the following reasons: 

• the existing pipeline rights-of-way can be used to a much greater degree where NGTL 
holds the disposition rights to that land and can ensure safe construction around their 
existing pipeline. This helps reduce potential effects by limiting the overall physical 
disturbance necessary to install the pipeline; 

• existing infrastructure (i.e., mainline valves and meter stations) can be easily tied into the 
new pipeline without requiring extra pipeline length or extra right-of-way; and 

• operations crews are able to monitor additional pipeline capacity with little increase in 
monitoring effort. 

NGTL evaluated whether alternative routes could meet the Project need and purpose. The route selection 
process for the Project is discussed in Section 4.0.  

The planned pipeline crossing method for seven of the watercourse crossings and the two fish-bearing 
drainages are isolated trenched methods. The trenched crossing methods are recommended for these nine 
crossings if water is present at the time of construction, while an open cut method is recommended for 
crossings that are dry or frozen to the bottom at the time of construction. The preferred method of crossing 
at the House River is a trenchless method (i.e., HDD). 

2.3 Location of the Project 

The Project is located in a forested setting within the RM of Wood Buffalo and Lac La Biche County. All 
lands traversed are Crown-owned within the Green Area of Alberta. The nearest potential human receptor 
to the Project is the Mariana Lake campground (approximately 3 km southwest), while the nearest 
community with full services is the City of Fort McMurray, approximately 95 km northeast. The Project will 
follow existing linear disturbance for approximately 77% of its length. The pipeline component of the Project 
will involve looping the existing natural gas transmission system to transport natural gas from the existing 
Pelican Lake Compressor Station at NW 29-81-16 W4M (KP 36.3) and travel east across Highway 63 to 
tie into the proposed Leismer East Compressor Station located at NE 33-80-13 W4M Project Footprint.

September 2014 / 496955/492475 

 
The pipeline construction right-of-way will be 32 m wide in order to accommodate construction activities, 
vehicle and equipment movement, and safe transportation of personnel. There will be a 13 m wide spoil 
side and 19 m wide working side. Additionally, temporary workspace of varying width will be provided at 
select locations along the entire length of the pipeline right-of-way to accommodate construction activities 
(e.g., at crossing locations, where extra trench depth is required, sharp sidebends, entry and exit points for 
HDD, areas where grading is warranted). Temporary workspace will also be required for log decks for 
temporary storage of merchantable timber.  

This construction right-of-way will overlap existing surface dispositions, where possible, to reduce the 
overall Project footprint. Where the pipeline parallels existing NGTL pipelines, the right-of-way will be 
reduced to 24 m with the working side remaining at 19 m and the spoil side overlapping the existing 
right-of-way by approximately 8 m to minimize the footprint of tree clearing. The compressor station and 
access road will measure approximately 300 m x 282 m and 259 m x 7 m, respectively. Where the Project 
parallels other existing easements, agreements have been sought to temporarily overlap these easements 
during construction to reduce the amount of “new” right-of-way required. This temporary construction 
right-of-way overlap must typically maintain a safety buffer distance from existing pipelines. Therefore, the 
location of adjacent pipelines within existing easements and the required buffer zone constitute the amount 
of temporary construction overlap of any existing right-of-way.  

The total land Footprint required to construct the Project is approximately 145 ha, of which approximately 
136.5 ha is for the pipeline components and 8.5 ha is for the compressor station components.  

2.4 Project Components 

2.4.1 Pipeline Construction and Operations 

The location and technical details of the components of the pipeline are summarized in Table 2.1. 

Construction equipment will travel along the right-of-way and access the route via existing access roads. 
No new permanent access or upgrading of existing access will be required for the pipeline construction. 
Design, construction and operations of the pipeline will be in compliance with all applicable codes, 
standards and regulations. Subject to regulatory approval, construction activities for the pipeline 
(i.e., stockpiling, flagging) are scheduled to commence in July 2015.

2.4.1.1 Pipeline Installation 

The total length of pipeline to be installed for the Project is 36.3 km. Pipeline construction will involve the 
following standard activities: engineering; construction surveying; clearing of vegetation; disposal; 
strippings salvage; grading (where warranted); stringing and welding; trenching; lowering-in; backfilling; 
hydrostatic testing; clean-up/reclamation; watercourse and wetland crossings; and pipeline integrity and 
validation. These activities are presented in Table 2.2 in the general order of occurrence during 
construction. 

TABLE 2.2 
 

PIPELINE CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES 

Construction Phase Associated Activities and Typical Equipment 
Engineering The Project will follow the requirements of the latest version of Canadian Standards Association (CSA) Standard Z662, Oil 

and Gas Pipeline Systems (CSA Z662-2011) and will be in compliance with the latest version of the National Energy Board 
Onshore Pipeline Regulations (NEB OPR). 

Construction Survey Activities include line-of-sight clearing with chain saws (where needed), flagging and staking of the boundaries of the 
construction right-of-way, temporary workspaces and facility sites, as well as marking the trench line and existing utilities. 
Avoidance areas, such as protected habitats or rare plants, will be appropriately fenced or flagged. 

Clearing Removal of snow, trees, shrubs, and other obstacles from the construction Footprint. Merchantable timber will be harvested 
and made available according to commercial use agreements. Typical equipment used for clearing activities includes chain 
saws, rotary grinders, feller-bunchers, hydro-axes, mulchers or other tree-clearing equipment, as well as skidders, dozers and 
backhoes. Rollback will be salvaged where possible. No new access roads are required for the pipeline component of the 
Project. 

Disposal Disposal of all non-salvageable vegetative debris that is not salvaged for merchantability will be disposed through burning or 
mechanical chipping/mulching. Burning will be conducted following the Forest Protection Regulations (Alberta Reg. 310/72). If 
timber and brush are disposed of by mechanical means (i.e., mulching or chipping), the activities will be carried out according 
to AESRD Industry Directive ID 1009-01 (Management of Wood Chips on Public Land). Typical equipment used during 
disposal includes mulchers, chainsaw, chippers and trucks. 

Strippings Handling Strippings will be salvaged at areas where grading is necessary. The area stripped is to correspond to the area to be graded. 
The width and depth of strippings salvage depends on a number of factors including: the soil conditions at the time of 
construction; microtopography; and grading requirements. Typical equipment used during strippings handling activities 
includes dozers, graders and backhoes. 

Grading Following strippings salvage, grading may be required at some locations on irregular ground surfaces (including temporary 
workspace), if necessary, to provide a safe work surface. Graders, backhoes and dozers may be used for this activity. 

Stringing and Welding Pipe joints will be transported to the right-of-way by trucks from a stockpile site yet to be determined. The pipe will be bent, 
lined-up, welded, joint-coated and inspected prior to being lowered into the trench. Typical equipment used includes pipe 
trucks, booms, bending machines, pick-up trucks, and x-ray or ultrasonic inspection equipment mounted on pick-up trucks or 
skids.  

Trenching The trench will be excavated using tracked excavators or wheel ditchers to a depth sufficient to ensure the depth of cover is in 
accordance or in excess of applicable codes. The typical depth of cover will be 1 m with additional depth provided at crossings 
of existing pipelines, roadways and watercourses.  

Lowering-In Welded pipe sections will be lowered into the trench by sideboom tractors and/or backhoes. Trench dewatering may be 
required prior to lowering-in the welded pipe to prevent the pipe from floating or for performing tie-in welds. Buoyancy control 
may be installed with the pipe in wetland areas or areas with a high water table. 

Backfilling Prior to backfilling, subsurface erosion control structures such as ditch plugs will be installed along with subdrains, where 
warranted, to control subsurface drainage along the trench. The trench will be backfilled using backhoes, graders, dozers or 
specialized backfilling equipment. Backfill material will generally consist of native trench spoil material. All available spoil will 
be crowned over the trench line to allow for settlement. Openings will be left in the crown at appropriate locations to allow for 
temporary and permanent cross right-of-way drainage. 

Testing All piping will be hydrostatically pressure tested and adhere to industry standards as well as relevant provincial and federal 
regulations. The proposed source location for hydrostatic test water is the unnamed lake located north of Mariana Lake and 
the proposed discharge location at the west end of the pipeline near the existing Pelican Lake Compressor Station. Typical 
equipment used during disposal includes air compressors, test heads, fill line, water trucks, pumps and cleaning pigs. 

Clean-Up and Reclamation Upon completion of construction activities, clean-up and reclamation procedures will be initiated using dozers, backhoes 
and/or graders. Garbage or debris remaining on-site will be removed and disposed of in compliance with local regulations. 
The pipeline right-of-way will be graded to restore pre-construction contours, where practical. 
The pipeline easement will be returned to a stable condition. The strippings will be replaced, with cross ditches and diversion 
berms installed on slopes to reduce the risk of erosion. On areas where erosion is not expected, natural revegetation will be 
the preferred method of reclamation.

TABLE 2.2  Cont'd 

Construction Phase Associated Activities and Typical Equipment 
Watercourse and Wetland 
Crossings 

Watercourse crossing methods will be decided in consultation with engineering and environmental specialists. Crossing 
methods typically used during watercourse construction include isolated or open cut methods. The TERA recommended 
pipeline crossing method for all the proposed watercourse crossings are isolated (if water present), open cut (if dry or 
frozen to bottom) methods except for the crossing at the House River in which a trenchless method has been 
recommended (Table 5 of Appendix 3). 

Pipeline Integrity Validation 
and Testing 

NGTL will validate the integrity of the new pipeline through CSA and/or NEB-approved methods prior to commissioning 
the pipeline using non-destructive examination and hydrostatic tests when the pipeline is filled with water to a pressure 
beyond normal daily operating pressures. 

 

The amount of above ground piping will be limited to that required to complete tie-ins to the existing facilities 
(i.e., Pelican Lake Compressor Station), tie-ins to the proposed Leismer East Compressor Station and to 
provide permanent pig launching and receiving capabilities, where required. Permanent above ground 
components required for the pipeline include new mainline block valves and crossover valves along the 
route. All above ground components will be enclosed in a fenced area. All Project components will be 
installed within the pipeline right-of-way boundaries and approved Pipeline Installation Leases (PILs).  

2.4.2 Compressor Station Construction and Operations 

The location and technical details of the components of the compressor station are summarized in 
Table 2.3. 

One permanent access road will be required for the compressor station construction. At the time the 
assessment was carried out, it was anticipated that the permanent access road would measure 
approximately 260 m long and 7 m wide. Design details are still being determined and the dimensions of 
the access road are subject to change in order to support the construction and operations of the proposed 
compressor station. Design, construction and operation of the compressor station and access road will be 
in compliance with all applicable codes, standards and regulations. Subject to regulatory approval, 
construction of the compressor station is scheduled to commence in May 2015.

2.4.2.1 Compressor Station Installation 

Compressor station construction will involve the following standard activities: engineering; construction 
surveying; clearing of vegetation; disposal; site preparation (strippings salvage); grading (where warranted); 
hydrovacing to confirm existing below ground utility locations; welding and hot tapping for the main line tie-
in; compressor station installation; clean-up; and revegetation of non-gravelled disturbed areas. These 
activities are presented in Table 2.4 in the general order of occurrence during construction. 

TABLE 2.4 
 

COMPRESSOR STATION AND ACCESS ROAD CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES 

Construction Phase Associated Activities and Typical Equipment 
Engineering The proposed compressor station will be designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable CSA standards, as 

well as federal, provincial and municipal requirements, and conditions of permits or authorizations. 
Construction Survey Activities include line-of-sight clearing with chain saws (where needed), flagging and staking of the boundaries of the 

compressor station site and temporary workspaces.  
Clearing Removal of snow, trees, shrubs, and other obstacles from the construction Footprint (including the compressor station site 

location and permanent access road). Merchantable timber will be harvested and made available according to commercial 
use agreements. Non-salvageable vegetative debris will be disposed or handled. Typical equipment used for clearing 
activities includes chain saws, rotary grinders, feller-bunchers, hydro-axes, mulchers or other tree-clearing equipment, as 
well as skidders, dozers and backhoes.  

Site Preparation (Strippings 
Salvage) 

Strippings will be salvaged during site preparation. Typical equipment used during strippings handling activities includes 
dozers, graders and backhoes. 

Grading Following strippings salvage, grading may be necessary to provide a safe work surface. Graders, backhoes and dozers 
may be used for this activity. 

Disposal Disposal of all non-salvageable vegetative debris that is not salvaged for merchantability will be through burning or 
mechanical chipping/mulching. Burning will be conducted following the Forest Protection Regulations (Alberta 
Reg. 310/72). If timber and brush are disposed of by mechanical means (i.e., mulching or chipping), the activities will be 
carried out according to AESRD Industry Directive ID 1009-01 (Management of Wood Chips on Public Land). Typical 
equipment used during disposal includes mulchers, chainsaw, chippers and trucks. 

Driven Piles and Gravel Pads The structural load of the ground at the compressor station site can be supported by compacted gravel pads or can be 
transferred to stronger and more competent strata at depth by mechanically driving piles into the ground to provide 
support for buildings on the site. Equipment used during soil/gravel compaction would include loaders and pile driving 
activities includes trucks, cranes and weights. 

Installation of Foundations and 
Below Ground Piping 

Foundations and trenches for below ground piping will be excavated using tracked excavators to a depth sufficient to 
ensure the depth of cover is in accordance or in excess of applicable codes. Minimum depth of cover will be 
approximately 0.9 m as per CSA Z662. Foundations will be staked and forms installed prior to pouring the concrete. A 
compacted soil or gravel pad will be provided for all concrete foundations. The compaction work will involve using dozers, 
backhoes and graders. Gravel will be installed within the fenced area. 

Installation of Compressor 
Packages (Buildings, 
Generator, Skids) 

Compressor building will be erected on site and the compressor package installed inside. Skid mounted buildings 
(including electrical building, mechanical skids, generator, etc.) will be brought on site and connected. Cable trays, pipe 
rack and gas piping will be installed and connected throughout the compressor station site. 

Clean-Up and Reclamation Upon completion of installation activities, interim reclamation procedures will be initiated using dozers, backhoes and/or 
graders. Garbage or debris remaining onsite will be removed and disposed of in compliance with local regulations.  
The disturbed sites outside of the fenced area will be returned to a stable condition. The salvaged strippings will be stored 
at locations where the risk of erosion is minimal. 

 

Permanent above ground components required for the compressor station will be limited to the amount 
necessary to complete tie-ins, where required. All above ground components associated with the 
compressor station will be enclosed in a fenced area and approved PIL(s).  

2.4.3 Temporary Infrastructure and Workspace 

Temporary infrastructure and workspace will be used solely during the construction phase of the Project 
and are related to the construction of the pipeline. Temporary infrastructure and workspace may include: 
access roads/shoo-flies; equipment and fuel storage sites; pipe stockpile sites; construction offices and 
camps; borrow pits; and temporary bridges over watercourses. Table 2.5 provides the activities associated 
with the construction of the temporary infrastructure and workspace required for the Project.

TEMPORARY INFRASTRUCTURE AND WORKSPACE CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES 

Construction Phase Associated Activities and Typical Equipment 
Engineering The temporary facilities will be designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable TransCanada and CSA 

standards, as well as federal, provincial and municipal requirements, and conditions of permits or authorizations. 
Site Preparation Initial site preparation will involve clearing of vegetation, where present, salvaging of topsoil and grading of the site, 

where warranted, using equipment similar to that described for construction of the pipeline and compressor station. 
Facility Construction Temporary facilities required to accommodate Project construction activities include additional access roads, 

equipment and fuel storage sites, pipe stockpile sites, contractor site offices and laydown yard (see Section 4.5). 
Temporary Access Road 
Construction 

A number of temporary access roads will be required to support the Project that will be built during the winter months 
by removing excess snow and adding water to the ground surface to facilitate frost penetration, and to provide a firm 
service for travel. 

Clean-Up and Reclamation Clean-up and reclamation procedures will be initiated using dozers, excavators and/or graders. Garbage or debris 
remaining on-site will be removed and disposed of in compliance with local regulations.  
The temporary facility areas will be returned to an equivalent land productivity and to pre-disturbance site conditions. 
All disturbed, non-cultivated, upland areas will be seeded with an appropriate seed mix as per the EPP (Appendix 1). 

 

2.4.4 Inspection 

NGTL will retain the services of a qualified Environmental Inspector(s) during all critical phases of 
construction of the Project (Section 8.0). The Environmental Inspector(s) will monitor construction activities 
and ensure the implementation of protection measures outlined in NGTL's documentation, including the 
EPP (Appendix 1) and the Environmental Alignment Sheets (Appendix 2) developed for the Project. 

2.4.5 Estimated Workforce Requirements 

Construction of the Project will involve a workforce of approximately 500 workers. The skills of the 
anticipated workforce will include heavy equipment operators, welders, labourers, teamsters, mechanics, 
foremen, surveyors, inspectors and field office support personnel. It is anticipated that the Project will be 
operated using existing resources and, therefore, no new permanent, part-time or full-time jobs will be 
directly created by the Project. However, the addition of this Project in the area could provide opportunity 
for an increase in maintenance work. 

2.4.6 Environmental Permits/Approvals

2.4.7 Construction Schedule  

Pipeline construction activities are expected to occur over an approximate 28 week period. Pipeline 
construction activities will be progressive commencing with survey and right-of-way preparation, and 
continuing through pipe stringing, welding, coating, trenching, lowering-in, backfilling, pipe inspection, 
clean-up and reclamation. These activities are performed sequentially beginning at NE 33-80-13 W4M and 
will move from east to west along the construction right-of-way for approximately 28 weeks with most of the 
work expected to be completed in 16 week period from November 2015 to February 2016. Areas that will 
take longer are tie-in locations, which are routinely completed and tested last. Testing will be conducted 
following installation of the pipeline (see Table 2.7). The installation of mainblock valves and crossover 
valves will be completed in conjunction with the mainline pipe installation. Pre-tested assemblies will be 
installed and tied into the pipeline following pressure testing of the mainline pipe.  

Pending regulatory approval, site preparation for the compressor station will begin in May 2015; the 
construction phase for the compressor station is anticipated to take approximately 40 weeks to complete.  

Due to timing restrictions on work within the KWBZ, migratory birds and protected caribou areas, 
construction is scheduled to begin, pending regulatory approval in May 2015 and continue through winter, 
therefore, frozen and non-frozen ground conditions can be expected during construction activities.

2.5 Operations and Maintenance 

TransCanada operates the NGTL System pursuant to an Operating Agreement between TransCanada and 
NGTL. TransCanada applies corporate policies in its operations of the NGTL System that are common to 
TransCanada’s operations of other federally-regulated projects. For the Project, TransCanada will operate 
the Project in accordance with all governing regulatory requirements, permit conditions and other approvals 
including the OPR-99 and CSA Z662-07, Oil and Gas Pipeline Systems. TransCanada will develop and 
implement a PCM Program to assess the effectiveness of mitigation and reclamation measures on soils, 
vegetation, watercourses and wetlands disturbed during construction of the pipeline. TransCanada will 
conduct monitoring and prepare maintenance plans and quality assurance/control programs to address any 
potential adverse environmental effects. 

TransCanada has systems in place to manage the safe operation and integrity of its existing pipelines and 
facilities. These programs will be expanded to include the Project. The new pipeline will have specific 
integrity management plans ensuring that the ongoing requirements of this pipeline are met through its 
service life. Internal inspection is an integral part of the TransCanada Canadian Gas Pipeline Integrity 
Management Program and the proposed in-line inspection facilities will be designed to allow passage of 
various types of in-line inspection including cleaning tools as well as high and low resolution in-line 
inspection tools. 

TransCanada has operations procedures that describe how its pipelines and facilities are operated and 
maintained by providing detailed information on right-of-way maintenance including information on Alberta 
One-Call, aerial reconnaissance, pipeline crossings, road usage, pipeline signage, brush control and weed 
control. This manual will be expanded to include work completed for the Project. 

2.6 Decommissioning or Abandonment 

The Project has been designed to operate for 40 years or more. Decommissioning or abandonment 
activities will comply with all applicable federal and provincial regulatory requirements. Any 
decommissioning or abandonment activities will require the approval of the NEB and other applicable 
agencies. These approvals will be applied for at the time of decommissioning planning. Decommissioning 
or abandonment are discussed further in Section 6.4.

3.0 COMMUNITY AND REGULATORY CONSULTATION AND ABORIGINAL 

ENGAGEMENT 
3.1 Introduction 

Consultation and engagement activities were initiated by NGTL in the second quarter of 2013. NGTL will 
continue to work closely with stakeholders and Aboriginal communities to identify and address concerns 
that may arise about the Project. Any potential issues or concerns to date have been addressed in this 
ESA. 

NGTL worked independently and in collaboration with TERA to consult with government agencies as well 
as local communities to collect information for incorporation into the ESA. Consultation and engagement 
provides those who could be affected by the Project with the opportunity to participate in the ESA. NGTL is 
committed to building long-term relationships with the communities within which it operates, and recognizes 
and respects the rights of stakeholders and communities, Aboriginal culture and the importance of land. 
NGTL believes that consultation develops mutual trust and helps to build co-operative working 
relationships. The goal of these programs is to share information about the plans and activities of the Project 
while receiving a clear understanding of how people may be affected by the Project. TERA is committed to 
assisting NGTL in achieving these objectives. 

3.2 Consultation and Engagement Objectives and Methods 

3.2.1 Consultation and Engagement Objectives 

The objectives of consultation were to: 

• share information about the Project, the proponent and the regulatory process;  

• obtain feedback on the potential effects of the Project; and 

• obtain input from federal and provincial regulatory agencies, stakeholders and Aboriginal 
communities on the Project design and ESA requirements. 

The Consultation and Aboriginal sections of the NEB Application for the Project provide a summary of public 
involvement activities conducted in association with the preparation of this ESA including consultation with 
federal, provincial and municipal government agencies, and engagement with Aboriginal communities and 
other interested parties, where applicable. Key environmental and socio-economic issues raised during the 
consultation and engagement program are discussed in the relevant sections of the ESA. The consultation 
and engagement conducted in association with the preparation of this ESA was designed to complement 
the NGTL consultation program.  

3.2.2 Consultation and Engagement Outcomes 

The results of the consultation and engagement have helped refine the ESA for the Project. With this 
information, NGTL identified issues, addressed concerns and responded to questions. Engagement has 
also provided communities and government with an understanding of the potential effects of the Project. 

Results of the consultation and engagement have been considered and incorporated throughout the ESA, 
where relevant, including the effects assessment and mitigation measures.  

3.3 Community and Stakeholder Engagement 

NGTL identified stakeholders potentially affected by the Project including Lac La Biche County, the 
Municipal District of Opportunity, AESRD, RM of Wood Buffalo, Alberta Culture, Alberta Tourism Parks and 
Recreation (ATPR), Regional Emergency Services, Canadian Wildlife Services and the Alberta Provincial 
Constituency of Lesser Slave Lake. Starting on May 15, 2013, stakeholders received an information

NGTL met with Owl River Métis Local No. 1949 on June 17 and 19, 2014 to provide Project information 
and to agree on an engagement process. As noted, Owl River Métis Local No. 1949 was not initially 
identified by Métis Nations of Alberta (MNA)-Region 1 as an MNA-Region 1 Metis Local requiring Project 
engagement. To date, Owl River Métis Local No. 1949 has not expressed any Project-specific issues or 
concerns, however, Owl River Metis Local No. 1949 has yet to submit result from the community-led TLU 
study. NGTL will continue engagement activities with Owl River Métis Local No. 1949 to address any 
potential future concerns about the Project.

Bigstone Cree Nation met with NGTL in June 2013 to discuss engagement for the Project. Bigstone Cree 
Nation informed NGTL that they did not have an interest in participating in Project engagement activities as 
the project is outside of their traditional territory. Fort McMurray Métis Local No. 2020 has not responded 
to invitations from NGTL to discuss engagement for the Project. NGTL remains open to discussing 
Project-specific issues with Heart Lake First Nation, Chipewyan Prairie Dene First Nation, Fort McMurray 
Métis Local No. 2020, Métis Nation of Alberta and Métis Nation of Alberta Zone 1, and will continue to 
provide regular updates. Beaver Lake Cree Nation has confirmed that it does not have any outstanding 
concerns about the Project. NGTL will continue to inform Beaver Lake Cree Nation about the Project. 

TERA, on behalf of NGTL, invited interested Aboriginal communities to participate in the biophysical studies 
conducted for the Project during which time the Project scope, timetable and location of the proposed 
Project was discussed. A TERA TEK Facilitator accompanied the participants selected by each community 
during the biophysical field studies to document potential impacts of the Project on environmental 
resources, explain potential construction techniques, describe Project specifications, collect and combine 
TEK, and ensure that proprietary information was kept in confidence. 

To date, TEK information has been gathered with 10 communities, including Christina River Dene Nation 
Council, Saddle Lake Cree Nation, Willow Lake Métis Local No. 780, Fort McMurray Métis Local No. 1935 
and Fort McMurray First Nation No. 468. TLU information for the Project has been collected and shared to 
date by Willow Lake Métis Local No. 780, Fort McMurray Métis Local No. 1935, Lakeland Métis Local No. 
1909 and Conklin Métis Local No. 193. Saddle Lake Cree Nation shared TLU in a TERA-led overflight of 
the Project. 

Aboriginal communities potentially affected by the Project have been invited to participate in the 2014 
supplemental biophysical field studies. Additional information gathered during ongoing engagement with 
Aboriginal communities will be incorporated into Project planning, including the EPP (Appendix 1) and the 
Environmental Alignment Sheets (Appendix 2), as appropriate. The results of Aboriginal participation during 
these 2014 studies and from any upcoming TLU studies will be provided to the NEB in a supplemental TK 
Report.  

New information regarding NGTL’s Aboriginal engagement is found in the Project Application 
(Attachment AM1 – Aboriginal Engagement Summary).

Liege Lateral Loop 2 – Thornbury Section Pipeline and 
the Leismer East Compressor Station Project 

September 2014 / 496955/492475 

 
4.0 ROUTE SELECTION 
4.1 Control Points 

The primary routing control points for the pipeline are identified as follows: 

• Source Control Point: Tie-in near the existing Pelican Compressor Station at 
12-29-81-16 W4M; and 

• Delivery Control Point: Tie-in at the proposed Leismer East Compressor Station (Delivery 
Control Point): NE 33-80-13 W4M. The proposed Leismer East Compressor Station is 
expected to ultimately take over the existing site capacity.  

4.2 Routing Considerations 

NGTL’s routing selection is governed by the control points as established by system design requirements. 
In addition, other various routing considerations are taken into account. The Project endpoints were defined 
based on the location of the existing pipeline infrastructure. Since the Project is a looping project to expand 
capacity, a primary routing consideration is placement adjacent to existing facilities. Other considerations 
include:  

• where practical, follow existing linear infrastructure (i.e., pipelines and roads); 

• limiting the length of the pipeline crossing environmentally sensitive areas such as 
protected, endangered or sensitive vegetation and wildlife habitat; 

• reducing the number of watercourse crossings, where feasible; 

• complying with applicable regulatory requirements; 

• avoiding identified socially and culturally important areas such as parks, natural areas, 
TLU sites (e.g., Indian Reserves [I.R.s], historic sites, heritage sites, cemeteries, etc.); 

• following or using existing clearings, where feasible; 

• crossing all roads at or as close to right angles as possible; 

• considering construction difficulty and associated costs; 

• using the shortest route practical; and 

• limiting conflicts with existing land and resource uses. 

The routing strategy was to install the pipeline parallel and adjacent to existing rights-of-way, where 
feasible. As a result, 77% (approximately 28 km) of the pipeline route parallels existing transmission pipeline 
and other linear infrastructure where the width of the new right-of-way has been reduced through 
overlapping of the existing rights-of-way. Where opportunities for paralleling existing infrastructure were not 
available, the pipeline route follows established clearings and cutlines. NGTL's preliminary route options 
were reviewed by aerial and ground reconnaissance in 2013. 

The preferred crossing at the House River is an approximate 1,600 m long HDD to minimize soil and river 
bed disturbance. An isolated trenched method (i.e., open cut) is the proposed contingency plan and involves 
an alternate route.  

Permanent and temporary access roads are required to support the Project. The permanent access road 
will be constructed during the spring/summer months (i.e., during construction of the compressor station) 
and the temporary access roads are expected to be constructed during the winter months by removing 
excess snow and adding water to the ground surface to facilitate frost penetration. Access road routing has

been selected to follow existing clearing, cutlines and previously used access routes to reduce the amount 
of clearing.  

Environmental disciplines conducting field work in (see Section 1.0) assessed the route for environmental 
concerns while considering the constraints of the source and delivery points as well as the routing 
considerations noted above. No route realignments resulted from the biophysical surveys.  

4.3 Pipeline Route 

The pipeline route is shown at a scale of 1:350,000 (Figure 1) and on the Environmental Alignment Sheets 
at a scale of 1:50,000. The Project is 36.3 km in length and parallels existing linear disturbance for 77% 
(approximately 28 km) of its length.  

4.4 Permanent Facility Siting 

A new compressor station is required to support the Project which will require approximately 8.6 ha of land. 
Siting of the compressor station was influenced by NGTL’s desire to limit the amount of new disturbance, 
as well as to optimize maintenance activities and the use of existing infrastructure (e.g., power lines, etc.) 
associated with NGTL’s existing facilities. The location was dictated by the proximity to the pipeline 
right-of-way that the compressor station was tying into, and as close as possible to Highway 63 to reduce 
the length of the access road.  

4.5 Temporary Workspace Siting 

Locations of known temporary workspace have been included in this ESA and other requirements will be 
determined prior to construction. The temporary workspace selection process has and will take into 
consideration any environmental issues (as identified in Section 6.0 and on the Environmental Alignment 
Sheets [Appendix 2]) and will ensure adherence to the site selection criteria noted below. It is of note that 
there is a great deal of flexibility for some temporary infrastructure and workspace (e.g., pipe stockpile 
sites), while other temporary workspace must be located at or in the immediate vicinity of a particular 
location (e.g., temporary workspace for soil handling where heavy grading is necessary). 

Temporary workspace was considered at various places along the route in order to accommodate 
construction activities and excavated material where there are changes in direction of the pipeline, area 
that require extra depth of excavation (i.e., road crossings), watercourse crossings, HDD staging areas and 
equipment staging areas.  

The following site selection criteria will be used to evaluate and select temporary infrastructure and 
workspace: 

• selection of an optimal location for construction needs; 

• avoidance, to the extent practical, of areas of native vegetation by maximizing the use of 
previously cleared or broken lands, or lands currently under industrial land use; 

• preferential selection of grassed areas over bush or treed areas when disturbance is 
necessary on lands supporting native vegetation; 

avoidance, to the extent practical, of known locations that provide site-specific habitat or habitat features to 
reduce potential impacts on wildlife (particularly species of concern (see Section 6.0); 

• avoidance, to the extent practical, of known sites that support known rare plant species 
or apply special mitigation (see Section 6.0); 

• avoidance, to the extent practical, of steep slopes, organic soils and poorly-drained areas; 

• avoidance, to the extent practical, of areas with known heritage resource or TLRU sites, 
or apply special mitigation (see Section 6.0);

• avoidance of locations adjacent to a conflicting land use where potential noise, dust or 

visual concerns could not be readily mitigated; and 

• preferential selection at sites that are already serviced by roads and utilities. 

The evaluation of potential temporary infrastructure and workspace will be conducted as far in advance of 
their intended use as practical to allow adequate time to choose and evaluate alternative sites. Mitigation 
measures will be used at temporary infrastructure and workspace as described in Section 6.0. All applicable 
landowners as well as municipal, provincial and federal approvals for a temporary infrastructure and 
workspace site or workspace will be acquired prior to the commencement of work at the site.

5.0 ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC SETTING 
This section describes the environmental and socio-economic settings encountered by the Project, using 
the spatial boundaries outlined in Section 1.4 and described in Section 6.2. Each spatial boundary is 
described following elements from the NEB Filing Manual (NEB 2014a): physical and meteorological 
environment; soil and soil productivity; water quality and quantity; air emissions; GHG emissions; acoustic 
environment; fish and fish habitat; wetlands; vegetation; wildlife and wildlife habitat; species at risk; human 
occupancy and resource use; heritage resources; traditional land and resource use; social and cultural well-
being; human health; infrastructure and services; navigation and navigation safety; and employment and 
economy. The environmental setting was compiled based on the following sources: 

• air quality, GHG, acoustic, aquatic, wetland, vegetation, wildlife and historical resource 
field studies conducted for the Project; 

• existing published literature including topographic maps, aerial photography, scientific 
papers and reference books, as well as municipal, provincial and federal government 
maps, reports, interactive websites, guides, information letters, fact sheets and 
databases; and 

• consultation and engagement with Aboriginal communities, regulatory authorities, 
stakeholders and the general public. 

Resource material was obtained by searching libraries, internet searches and documents from regulatory 
authorities. References used in the preparation of the environmental and socio-economic setting are cited 
in Section 10.0. 

The results of the air, GHG, noise, aquatics, wetlands, vegetation, wildlife and TEK/TLU supporting studies 
are summarized throughout Section 5.0, where applicable. Methodologies for the air and GHG assessment, 
noise impact assessment, aquatic assessment, wetland evaluation, vegetation survey, wildlife report and 
TK report are included in Appendices 3 to 10. The potential Project-related effects and mitigation are 
presented in Section 6.0. In addition, select environmental information is provided on the Environmental 
Alignment Sheets (Appendix 2). 

5.1 Physical and Meteorological Environment 

This subsection presents a summary of the physical and meteorological environmental setting found in the 
Physical Environment and Soils LSA (Figure 5.1). It describes the physical, geological and meteorological 
conditions documented in the Physical Environment and Soils LSA and beyond to include the nearest 
meteorological stations.  

The potential effects and key mitigation pertaining to physical and meteorological environment are 
discussed in Section 6.2.1 and full mitigation measures are provided in the EPP (Appendix 1).  Issues 
related to the meteorological environment are discussed Effects of the Environment on the Project 
(Section 6.5) and Air Emissions (see Sections 5.4 and 6.2.4). 

The Physical Environment and Soils LSA is defined as the ZOI likely to be affected by terrain instability 
during construction and operations of the Project and consists of a 1 km wide band centred on the pipeline 
route right-of-way centre line (i.e., 500 m on both sides of the centre line) and 500 m around the perimeter 
of the compressor station. The Physical Environment and Soils LSA is described in greater detail in 
Section 6.2.1 including the rationale for the determination of this spatial boundary. Potential effects are not 
anticipated to extend beyond the Physical Environment LSA and, therefore, a Physical Environment RSA 
has not been established.

5.1.1 Physiography 

The proposed compressor station and a portion of the pipeline route (KP 0 to KP 12.9) are located in the 
Northern Alberta Upland Natural Physiographic Region, in the Stony Mountain Upland Subregion where 
landforms are characterized by undulating to rolling morainal till, rolling and blanket glaciofluvial, and 
undulating morainal deposits (Pettapiece 1986). The remainder of the pipeline route is located in the 
Northern Alberta Lowland Physiographic Region in the Wabasca Lowland Subregion (KP 13 to KP 36.3) 
where landforms are characterized by blanket and veneer glaciofluvial and undulating morainal till materials 
(Pettapiece 1986). Elevations along the proposed route range from approximately 615 to 715 m asl. 

5.1.2 Bedrock Geology 

This subsection identifies the types of bedrock that may be encountered along the pipeline route and at the 
proposed compressor station location. The characteristics of the formations are included as they may affect 
construction activities. Both glaciation and bedrock geology are precursors to surficial deposits and soils, 
which may influence the chemistry of the soil profile within trench depth. The Project is underlain by bedrock 
consisting entirely of Upper Cretaceous aged formations.  

The geological groups and formations encountered along the proposed Project and their associated rock 
types are identified in Table 5.1.1.

5.1.3 Surficial Geology 

In general, the surficial geology underlying the Project can be described as organic deposits, with various 
morainal deposits along the pipeline. This subsection identifies surficial deposits that may be encountered 
within trench depth along the pipeline route and around the compressor station site. Characteristics of 
surficial deposits are related to potential concerns such as compaction, rutting, trench instability, erosion 
hazard and steep topography. The deposits underlying the proposed Project are summarized in 
Table 5.1.2.

Diamicton (till) is deposited directly by glacial ice with a mixture of clay, silt, and 
sand, as well as minor pebbles, cobbles, and boulders. Deposits are 
characterized by a lack of distinctive topography. Locally, this unit may contain 
blocks of bedrock, stratified sediment, or lenses of glaciolacustrine and/or 
glaciofluvial sediment.

5.1.4 Climate 

The Project is located in the Central Mixedwood Natural Subregion and Lower Boreal Highlands Natural 
Subregion of Alberta (Natural Regions Committee 2006). The climate of the Central Mixedwood Natural 
Subregion is characterized by short, warm summers and long, cold winters, however, given the size of the 
subregion, there is recognizable north-south variability in both mean annual temperature and precipitation 
(Natural Regions Committee 2006). The climate of the Lower Boreal Highlands Natural Subregion differs 
from the neighboring Central Mixedwood Natural Subregion in that winters tend to be colder and summers 
are slightly warmer. This is likely a reflection of the dual influence of higher elevations and more northerly 
latitudes (Natural Regions Committee 2006). Meteorological data were obtained from Environment 
Canada’s Fort McMurray station, located approximately 120 km from the Project location to represent 
climate normals for the Project. The data were collected from 1981 to 2010 and are provided in Table 5.1.3 
(Environment Canada 2014a).

an average of 17.1°C and the coldest month is January with an average temperature of -17.4°C. Monthly 
wind speeds are highest in April and May with wind speeds of 11.3 km/h and 11.0 km/h, respectively. 

5.1.5 Ground Stability 

The Project does not encounter any areas of permafrost (Natural Resources Canada [NRCan] 2009a). The 
Project location is situated on Cretaceous bedrock which is considered vulnerable to landslides, however, 
the seismic hazard is low on lands crossed by the Project (NRCan 2009b, NRCan 2010a,b). A search of 
the Geographic Land Information Management Planning System (GLIMPS) identified that there are no 
protective notations (PNTs) for ground instability-related Crown dispositions crossed by the proposed 
Project (Alberta Energy 2014a).  

5.1.6 Wind and Water Erosion 

NRCan evaluates the risk of wind erosion based on the nature of local climate and vegetation. Areas with 
drier, warmer climates and with sparse vegetation cover are more vulnerable to wind erosion. Based on 
local climate and vegetation, NRCan considers the Project to be located in an area where wind erosion risk 
is negligible (NRCan 2009c). However, some erosion (e.g., slumping) was observed during the Aquatics 
assessment (Appendix 3) on the steeper valley slopes along the House River valley, including in the Project 
area. 

5.1.7 Natural Hazards 

No major tornadoes or hailstorms have occurred in the Physical Environment and Soils LSA 
(NRCan 2009d,e). The risk of fire surrounding the Project location is considered moderate (NRCan 2009f). 
The Project is not located within a mapped floodway, flood fringe or overland flow area (AESRD 2014b).  

5.2 Soils and Soil Productivity 

This subsection presents a summary of the soil settings found in the Soils LSA (Figure 5.1). It describes 
the soil characteristics associated with soil landscapes and any known contamination found in the Physical 
Environment and Soils LSA.  

The potential effects and key mitigation pertaining to soil and soil productivity are discussed in Section 6.2.2 
and full mitigation measures are provided in the EPP (Appendix 1). 

Based on a close correlation and relationship between the effects of the Project to both the physical 
environment and soils (i.e., construction activities), the spatial boundary of the Physical and Meteorological 
Environment LSA was used to define the spatial boundary of the Soils LSA. This consists of a 1 km wide 
band centred on the pipeline route right-of-way centre line (i.e., 500 m on both sides of centre line) and 
500 m around the perimeter of the compressor station. The Physical Environment and Soils LSA is 
described in greater detail in Section 6.2.2, including the rationale for the determination of this spatial 
boundary. Potential effects are not anticipated to extend beyond the Soils LSA and, therefore, a Physical 
Environment RSA has not been established.  

5.2.1 Contaminated Soils 

As noted, the pipeline route will parallel existing disturbance for approximately 77% of its length. Potential 
contaminants of concern may be present from previous pipeline construction activities or may occur during 
construction and maintenance activities. These may include compounds routinely used in pipeline 
construction, such as fusion bond epoxy, liquid epoxy pipe coating, paint and hydrocarbons. The  pipeline 
route does not encounter any sites listed on the Federal Contaminated Sites Inventory (Treasury Board of 
Canada Secretariat 2014). 

5.2.2 Soil Characteristics 

The Project is located in the Green Area of Alberta in a forested setting and parallels existing, previously 
disturbed linear disturbance for approximately 77% (28 km) of its length. The Project is located entirely on 
Crown-owned lands in a forested setting within the Green Area of Alberta. Lands crossed by the pipeline 
construction right-of-way consist primarily of a native vegetation with intermittent areas of anthropogenic

usage (e.g., pipelines, roads, etc.). Land use along the pipeline route is approximately 73% forested and 
the remainder of the route is disturbed or regenerating cut. Land use at the proposed Leismer East 
Compressor Station is disturbed land. Present land use is shown on the Environmental Alignment Sheets 
(see Appendix 2).   

Common soils are Gray Luvisols (often gleyed) with Organic soils and Gleysols in the wetlands (Natural 
Regions Committee 2006). Exploratory soil surveys in the Project LSA were previously conducted by 
Wynnyk et al. (1963), Lindsay et al. (1957) and Odynsky et al. (1961). Dominant soils in the area are 
described in Table 5.2.1.

5.3 Water Quality and Quantity 

This subsection presents a summary of existing information and findings related to water quality and 
quantity (i.e., surface and groundwater) within the Water Quality and Quantity LSA and Aquatics RSA 
(Figure 5.2).  

The potential effects and key mitigation pertaining to water quality and quantity are discussed in 
Section 6.2.3 and full mitigation measures are provided in the EPP (Appendix 1). The locations of 
watercourse crossings along the pipeline route are identified on the Environmental Alignment Sheets 
(Appendix 2) and in the Fish Technical Report (Appendix 3).  

The Water Quality and Quantity LSA is defined as a 1 km band centred on the pipeline route right-of-way 
centre line (i.e., 500 m on both sides of the centre line) to incorporate effects that may extend beyond the 
Footprint (e.g., water erosion). The Aquatics RSA consists of a 30 km band centred on the pipeline route 
right-of-way centre line (i.e., 15 km on both sides of the centre line). The RSA also includes a 15 km long 
downstream extension along the Athabasca River and a 2 km upstream extension along the House River, 
from the Athabasca/House River confluence, with a 500 m buffer on both sides of each river. The Water 
Quality and Quantity LSA and Aquatics RSA are described in greater detail in Sections 6.2.3 and 6.2.7, 
respectively, including the rationale for the determination of these boundaries.

5.3.1 Surface Water Quality 

Surface water quality varies due to physical (e.g., temperature), chemical (e.g., metals) and biological 
(e.g., bacteria) characteristics (AESRD 2014c). Natural and anthropogenic activities both directly and 
indirectly influence surface water quality characteristics. Natural factors responsible for influencing water 
quality include precipitation, soil type, geology and groundwater flow (AESRD 2014c). Humans are also 
responsible for influencing surface water quality. Point sources (e.g., sewage outfalls) and non-point 
sources (e.g., logging) can introduce materials into waterbodies (AESRD 2014c).  

Surface water quantity influences surface water quality (AESRD 2014c). High precipitation events 
(e.g., storms) elevate surface runoff, which facilitates increased transport of materials from land to water, 
yielding reduced water quality. Conversely, low precipitation events (e.g., drought) may influence water 
quality as less surface runoff enters waterbodies. 

The House River sub-basin is contained within the Athabasca Basin, which is known to be used primarily 
for the forestry industry (Hatfield Consultants 2011).  

5.3.2 Surface Water Quantity 

Drainage basins and watercourses crossed by the pipeline route were identified and characterized through 
a combination of desktop analysis and open water assessments conducted in July and August 2013. A 
subsequent field visit occurred in May 2014, to assess potential drainages that were not observed during 
the initial desktop assessment and helicopter flyover. See Appendix 3 for details on field data collection and 
methodology.  

The Project is located in the House River sub-basin. The House River generally flows northwest for 
approximately 80 km until its confluence with the Athabasca River. The pipeline route crosses the House 
River, Dropoff Creek, an unnamed tributary of the House River and several unnamed tributaries of Dropoff 
Creek. Dropoff Creek is a direct tributary of the House River. Several fish-bearing and nonfish-bearing 
drainages are also considered in the assessment. A complete list of watercourse crossings along the 
pipeline route is provided in Appendix 3.  

There are no sections of designated or nominated Canadian Heritage Rivers crossed by or near the pipeline 
route in Alberta (Canadian Heritage Rivers System 2011). The pipeline route does not cross any of the 13 
designated irrigation districts in Alberta (Alberta Agriculture and Rural Development 2013).  

Aquatic Environmentally Significant Areas (AESA) in Alberta are defined under provincial legislation as 
those areas that are critical to the long-term maintenance of biological diversity and quality of water 
resources (Fiera Biological Consulting Ltd. [Fiera] 2010a). AESAs are categorized and defined based on 
seven different criteria:  

• areas that contain species of conservation concern;  

• areas that contain rare or unique aquatic ecosystems;  

• areas that contain habitat for aquatic focal species; 

• species groups or their habitat;  

• areas that contribute to water quality;  

• areas of biological complexity;  

• areas of intact complexity and/or biodiversity; and 

• areas that contribute to water quantity. 

There are four AESAs that are encountered by the pipeline route component of the Project (Table 5.3.1).

5.3.2.1 Historical Streamflow 

The Water Survey of Canada maintains a hydrometric monitoring station on the House River at Highway 
63, Alberta (Station No. 07CB002) (Environment Canada 2010a). This station is approximately 50 km 
upstream of the proposed crossing of House River at KP 35.01 (HDD route option). The annual high flow 
event typically occurs from May to June, and flows steadily decline through late summer and fall. Flow data 
are not available during the winter months (i.e., November to February), however, this is expected to be 
when the lowest flows occur. Figure 5.3 shows that mean monthly flows are lowest in March at 0.59 m³/s 
and mean flows are highest in May at 6.52 m³/s (Environment Canada 2010a).  

Data for this watercourse are presented on Figure 5.3 and in Table 5.3.2, and include mean, maximum and 
minimum monthly discharge.

5.3.3 Groundwater Quantity and Quality 

Groundwater is the water found beneath the ground surface, in the saturated zone, responsible for filling 
spaces of air between particles (e.g., sand, gravel) (Alberta Environment 2010a). Groundwater quality 
varies due to natural differences in geology (i.e., sand, gravel) and hydrology (i.e., precipitation, soil 
moisture). Groundwater quality can be affected by both natural (e.g., naturally occurring high concentrations 
of calcium) and anthropogenic (e.g., introduction of fertilizers) influences (Alberta Environment 2010b).  

For groundwater to be recoverable, it must exist in an aquifer (i.e., underground layers of water-bearing 
permeable rock) (Alberta Environment 2010a). Groundwater flow is controlled by gravity and the physical 
characteristics of the materials through which it flows (i.e., type of material, porosity, slope). As a result of 
natural (e.g., surface water flooding) or anthropogenic influences (e.g., construction of reservoirs), 
groundwater flow patterns can be affected.  

5.3.3.1 Groundwater Wells 

Groundwater is a primary source of water for the population of Alberta. Water well records within 500 m of 
the centre line of the pipeline construction right-of-way were reviewed. A total of three wells were identified, 
including:  

• one well for domestic use; and 

• two wells for industrial use (AESRD 2014d). 

5.3.3.2 Springs 

Meinzer, as stated in Borneuf, defines a spring as “…a place where, without the agency of man, water flows 
from a rock or soil upon the land or into a body of surface water” (Borneuf 1983). 

There are no documented springs along the pipeline route or in the vicinity of the compressor station site.  

5.3.4 Local and Traditional Ecological Knowledge 

Community members expressed concerns about potential pipeline ruptures and herbicide application 
affecting water quality and in turn fish and fish habitat (Section 5.7) during biophysical field studies for the 
Project. Full results of the aquatics TEK collected including issues and concerns related to aquatics 
resources as well as proposed mitigation measures and/or responses to those issues are compiled in the 
TK Report in Appendix 10.  

5.4 Air Emissions 

This subsection presents a summary of existing conditions, ambient air quality and existing criteria air 
contaminant (CAC) emissions from industries in the Air Emissions RSA as well as the methodology used 
to assess CAC emissions associated with the Project. The potential effects and key mitigation pertaining 
to air quality are discussed in Section 6.2.4 and full mitigation measures are provided in the EPP 
(Appendix 1). 

The Air Emissions RSA is defined as a 5 km wide band centred on the proposed construction right-of-way 
(i.e., 2.5 km on both sides) and a 12 km by 12 km area centred on the compressor station. The Air Emissions 
RSA is the area where the direct and indirect influence of other activities could overlap with the 
Project-specific effects from Project construction and operations and cause cumulative effects on air quality. 
Further rationale regarding the RSA extent is provided in Section 6.2.4. The study area considered is 
described in detail and illustrated in Appendix 4.  

No Air Emissions LSA was established for the Project since local effects from air emissions are included in 
the assessment for the RSA and warrant no separate assessment.

5.4.1 Environment and Regulatory Setting 

5.4.1.1 Meteorology  

The meteorological setting is important to input the modelling of the dispersion Project related air emissions 
(Appendix 4). Winds in the Project area show minimal spatial variation due to the relatively flat terrain and 
few topographical features in the Air Emissions RSA. A wind rose (frequencies of wind-speed ranges as a 
function of the direction from which winds are blowing) for the Project location is provided in Figure 3 of 
Appendix 4 illustrating the distribution of wind speed and wind direction based on 5 years of AESRD 
developed meteorological data (2002 to 2006) for the Project location. The more frequent winds at the 
Project location tend to be from the west-southwest and southwest directions. 

5.4.1.2 Characterization of Project-Related Air Quality Emissions 

The primary sources of CACs during construction will be from land clearing and open burning activities as 
well as from vehicle and equipment operation. During operations, the main source of CAC emissions will 
be the compressor at the compressor station, followed by the boiler. Very small emissions are expected as 
a result of helicopter use for maintenance and inspection purposes These activities are known to result 
emissions of  in nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter less than 2.5 µm in 
diameter (PM2.5). Sulphur dioxide (SO2) is not included in this assessment, because the product to be 
transported is sweet natural gas and the sulphur content of equipment fuel is very low. CO was considered 
to be a minor pollutant since emission rates are low and corresponding objectives/standards are relatively 
high (see Appendix 4). Only small amounts of volatile organic compounds are released during vehicle 
operations as fugitives, and are therefore, not included in this assessment. Facility (i.e.¸ compressor station) 
and pipeline fugitive emissions during operations are expected to be predominantly CH4 and CO2 and are 
discussed in Section 5.5. 

Nitrogen dioxide is photochemically reactive and tends to be in equilibrium with NO, therefore, emissions 
of the sum of NO2 and NO, known as nitrogen oxides (NOx), are typically estimated. Nitrogen oxides are 
the primary emissions of concern from combustion sources with respect to short-term local effects. Nitrous 
oxide (N2O), which is also created during combustion processes, is a GHG and discussed in Section 5.5. 
Emissions of PM2.5 are primarily from the combustion processes in construction equipment compressor and 
boiler and from fugitive dust during construction activities. 

5.4.1.3 Applicable Air Quality Regulation and Objectives 

Table 5.4.1 presents the applicable ambient air quality objectives and guidelines for the contaminants of 
interest (NO2 and PM2.5). AESRD had developed Alberta Ambient Air Quality Objectives and Guidelines 
(AAQO), based on an evaluation of scientific, social, technical, and economic factors. These limits provide 
regulatory benchmarks against which pollutant concentrations can be measured and assessed. All 
industrial facilities, including the proposed compressor station, must be designed and operated such that 
ambient air quality remains below objectives. 

TABLE 5.4.1 
 

APPLICABLE AMBIENT AIR QUALITY OBJECTIVES AND GUIDELINES  

Compound Averaging Period AAQO (µm/m3) 
NO2 1-hour 300 

24-hour 45 
PM2.5 1-hour 80 

24-hour 30 

Source: AESRD (2013e) 
 

Objectives and standards are provided for context only. Exceedances of the objectives are not expected 
from Project construction or operations. Brief episodes of high ambient concentrations of PM2.5 might occur 
in close vicinity of Project construction activities, which is common for any typical construction activity.

The Municipal Development Plan (MDP) of Wood Buffalo cites the protection and enhancement of air 
quality (objective 2.3.4) as a primary objective for environmental stewardship in the region (RM of Wood 
Buffalo 2011). The Lower Athabasca Regional Plan (LARP) also cites the management of air emissions to 
maintain acceptable air quality (Government of Alberta 2012a). 

5.4.2 Existing Air Quality Emissions and Ambient Background 

The Project lies within the Wood Buffalo Airshed Zone which is monitored by the Wood Buffalo 
Environmental Association (2014). Wood Buffalo Environmental Association is one of the eight air sheds in 
Alberta that reports hourly air monitoring data to the provincial Clean Air Strategic Alliance. Baseline air 
quality within the Air Emissions RSA for the Project is influenced primarily by regional industrial air emission 
sources, and long–range transport of substances emitted from distant sources. The region surrounding the 
Project is primarily remote with few human receptors of pollutants.  

Table 5.4.2 presents existing emissions in the Air Emissions RSA. The AltaGas Ltd. Mariana Compressor 
Station is the only documented industrial emissions source that is located within the Air Emissions RSA. 
Emissions rates associated with this station are estimated and presented in Appendix 4.

Existing ambient air quality for CACs was obtained using publically available data from a representative 
monitoring station in Alberta. Observations at the Anzac station, located approximately 77 km northeast of 
the Project, indicate that ambient background concentrations for NO2 and PM2.5 less than 25% of the 
AAAQO for all averaging periods (Appendix 4). Since that the Anzac station is in proximity to significant 
third party emitters near Fort McMurray, background concentrations obtained from the station are 
conservatively higher than the expected background in the Project Air Emissions RSA.  

5.5 Greenhouse Gas Emissions 

This subsection summarizes existing GHG emissions as well as those associated with the Project. Since 
GHGs contribute to global climate change, the spatial boundary for GHG emissions is international. 
Therefore, GHGs related to the Project are compared to local, provincial and federal GHG emissions and 
assessed in terms of their overall contribution to global climate change. A GHG assessment for the Project 
was completed in 2014 and is provided in Appendix 4. The discussion of the potential impacts and mitigation 
options pertaining to GHG emissions are discussed in Section 6.2.5. 

5.5.1 Environment and Regulatory Setting 

The largest contributing GHG in Canada is carbon dioxide (CO2), which is released as a by-product of fossil 
fuel combustion. Other classes of GHG, which are commonly considered for accounting purposes, include 
methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), perfluorocarbons (PFC) and 
hydrofluorocarbons (HFC). The Project will be responsible for GHG emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O. No 
processes associated with Project activities are known to emit PFC, HFC, or SF6. Total GHG emissions 
were expressed in CO2-equivilant (CO2e), which is each gas’ total emissions multiplied by its 100-year 
global warming potential (GWP) (see Appendix 4). 

 Approximately 80% of Canada's total national GHGs are associated with the production or consumption of 
fossil fuels (Environment Canada 2010b). In Alberta, the oil and gas sector substantially contributes to 
overall increases in provincial GHG emissions (AENV 2008). However, GHG emissions associated with oil 
and gas transportation activities are relatively minor and mainly associated with stationary combustion 
devices used to transport the products (e.g., compressor stations).

5.5.1.1 Characterization of Project-Related Greenhouse Gas Emissions 

The primary sources of GHG emissions during construction will be from land clearing and open burning 
activities as well as from fuel combustion related to vehicle and equipment operation. During operations, 
GHG emission sources will primarily be attributed the operation of the compressor station, with minor 
contributions from vehicle and helicopter use for maintenance and inspection purposes. 

5.5.1.2 Greenhouse Gas Regulations and Objectives 

This section presents existing GHG regulations and objectives in the jurisdictions of the Project. Those that 
are not applicable to the Project are provided for reference only. 

AESRD has developed the Specified Gas Emitters Regulation (SGER) (AESRD 2014e), which requires 
reduction of emission intensities by facilities exceeding GHG emissions of 100,000 tonnes CO2e per year. 
Reporting requirements apply to facilities exceeding 50,000 tonnes CO2e per year (AESRD 2014e). The 
regulations do not apply to temporary emissions from construction. Since the Project will become part of 
the NGTL system, which is considered a single facility under these regulations, Project emissions during 
operations will be included in the total emissions of the NGTL system and will not add to current reporting 
requirements.  

No GHG targets have been set by federal legislation, however, Environment Canada’s GHG Emissions 
Reporting Program requires facilities emitting more than 50,000 tonnes CO2e to report to a federal registry. 
Project emissions during operations will be included in the currently existing reporting requirement for the 
NGTL system. 

The MDP of Wood Buffalo cites the promotion of environmental development practices to reduce GHG 
emissions (Objective 2.2.2) as a primary objectives for environmental stewardship in the region (RM Wood 
Buffalo 2011). No GHG emission reduction or reporting requirements are specified. 

The Alberta Association of Municipal Districts and Counties and AESRD are working together on a number 
of initiatives towards safeguarding the environment. The MD of Wood Buffalo is currently developing an 
aerobic landfill to reduce GHG emissions contributions in the region (Project Recovery Management 2013). 
There are currently no reduction or reporting requirements applicable to the Project. 

5.5.2 Existing Greenhouse Gas Emissions 

Existing provincial and national GHG emissions were obtained from Environment Canada’s most recent 
2012 National Inventory Report (Environment Canada 2014b). Table 5.5.1 lists 2012 provincial and national 
total annual emissions. Environment Canada is currently revising, in collaboration with provincial/territorial 
counterparts, the breakdown of total emissions by province and territory to reflect methodological 
improvements. For example, total GHG emissions presented below are based on different GWP. Further 
justification and observations are provided in Appendix 4.

5.6 Acoustic Environment 

This subsection summarizes the existing acoustic environment in and around the Acoustic Environment 
LSA. Potential effects related to the Project and key mitigation pertaining to the acoustic environment are 
discussed in Section 6.2.6. Noise arising from Project construction and operations and the potential effects 
on wildlife are discussed in Section 6.2.10 and full mitigation measures are provided in the EPP 
(Appendix 1). Detailed information and Figures regarding the Acoustic Environment is provided in the NIA 
conducted for this Project (Appendix 4). 

The Acoustic Environment LSA is defined as a 1.5 km band centred on the Project Footprint (as opposed 
to the proposed construction centre line) to measure noise levels at the fenceline (i.e., to incorporate 
temporary workspace, etc.) and a 1.5 km boundary around the proposed compressor station property 
fenceline. Detailed information regarding the Acoustic Environment is provided in Section 2.2 of Appendix 4.  

5.6.1 Regulatory Standards 

Specific noise and/or sound level criteria are not provided in the NEB Filing Manual (2014); however, 
reference is made to the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB), which is currently 
regulated by the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER). The AER regulates noise through the ERCB Directive 
038 (ERCB 2007) outlining the requirements for NIAs, methodology and reporting requirements.  

Local noise by-laws for the RM of Wood Buffalo (No. 83/24) and Lac La Biche County (No. 09-021) were 
considered in the NIA conducted for the Project (Appendix 4).  The NIA assumed construction activities will 
be conducted during daytime hours, and therefore in compliance with the listed local noise by-laws.  

5.6.2 Existing Ambient Noise and Noise Receptors 

A field noise monitoring program was conducted by RWDI on June 5 and 6, 2014 to measure the existing 
noise levels in the Project area, as outline in Directive 038. Current sources of noise emissions in the Project 
area are from existing oil and gas facilities and intermittent sources such as vehicle traffic. Other sources 
of noise included natural sounds (e.g., wildlife and wind) and low flying aircrafts.  At the proposed Leismer 
East Compressor Station site, there are two existing oil and gas facilities (a TCPL compressor station and 
an Athabasca Oil Sands Ltd. Pump station); however, the NIA found that the noise from highway traffic was 
the dominant source in the area.  

Given the remote location of the Project, there are no permanent receptors located within the Acoustic 
Environment LSA. The nearest potential human receptor is the campground located in the Human 
Occupancy and Resource Use (HORU) RSA near Mariana Lake (Mussio Ventures Ltd. 2012). The Mariana 
Lake Forest Recreation Area is located approximately 2.2 km south west of KP 2.0 (AltaLIS 2008); however, 
anticipated sound levels during Project construction and compressor station operations are not expected 
to a major source of sound for recreation users at this location. Given the lack of sensitive receptors in the 
Acoustic Environment LSA, no specific noise mitigation has been included in the ESA or EPP.  

During construction of the pipeline, sound levels are anticipated to be above the permissible sound level 
(PSL), as outlined in the AER Directive 038 (ERCB 2007)are expected to occur during daytime hours. 
Additionally, pipeline construction is progressive and construction noise is not expected to be sustained at 
any given location throughout the duration of pipeline construction activities. During operations of the 
proposed Leismer East Compressor Station, the NIA  found that noise levels will be in compliance with the 
daytime and nighttime PSLs of 50 and 40 dBA, respectively, as outlined in the AER Directive 038 
(ERCB 2007). Additionally, the potential for public concern is low, considering there are no sensitive 
receptors located in the Acoustic Environment LSA.  

5.7 Fish and Fish Habitat 

This subsection presents a summary of the findings related to fish and fish habitat in watercourses and fish-
bearing drainages crossed by the pipeline route component of the Project. This setting discusses fish and 
fish habitat in the Fish and Fish Habitat LSA (Figure 5.4) and the Aquatics RSA.

September 2014 / 496955/492475 

 
Potential Project-related effects and key mitigation pertaining to fish and fish habitat are discussed in 
Section 6.2.7 and full mitigation measures are provided in the EPP (Appendix 1). The habitat potential for 
spawning, rearing, wintering and migration was rated at fish-bearing waterbody crossings identified along 
the route and is documented in the Fish Technical Report (Appendix 3). 

The Fish and Fish Habitat LSA consists of an area 100 m upstream of the proposed watercourse crossings 
and a minimum of 300 m downstream. An example of a typical Fish and Fish Habitat LSA is shown of 
Figure 5.4. The Aquatics RSA is the same as that used for Water Quality and Quantity and is shown on 
Figure 5.2. The Aquatics RSA consists of a 30 km band centred on the construction right-of-way centre line 
(i.e., 15 km on both sides of the centre line). The RSA also includes a 15 km long downstream extension 
along the Athabasca River and a 2 km upstream extension along the House River, from the 
Athabasca/House River confluence, with a 500 m buffer on both sides of the river. The Fish and Fish Habitat 
LSA and Aquatics RSA are described in greater detail in Section 6.2.7, including the rationale for the 
determination of these boundaries. 

The Project is located within the House River sub-basin within the Athabasca River Basin in northeast 
Alberta. The Athabasca River flows 1,538 km northeast across Alberta from its headwaters in Jasper 
National Park to Lake Athabasca. Additional information about this basin, hydrology and the named 
watercourses crossed by the pipeline route are provided in Appendix 3.

5.7.1 Areas of Special Interest 

There are no national or provincial parks or Canadian Heritage Rivers crossed by or near the Project 
(Canadian Heritage Rivers System 2011). As noted, there are four AESAs that are crossed by the pipeline 
route. Refer to Section 5.3 for AESA criteria and for more information on AESAs crossed by the pipeline 
route.  

5.7.2 Fish Communities 

The fish communities near the pipeline route are mixed assemblages of both coldwater species 
(e.g., salmonids) and coolwater (e.g., percids and esocids) species. The fish species that may occur near 
the pipeline route are primarily spring or summer spawners, although some winter and fall spawners occur 
(e.g., burbot and mountain whitefish, respectively). A list of all fish species that may be found in 
watercourses crossed by or near the pipeline route is provided in Table 5.7.1.  

There are no watercourses within 30 m of the proposed compressor station.

5.7.2.1 Species of Management Concern 

Species of management concern include all sportfish species as well as non-sportfish species that are 
listed federally (i.e., by COSEWIC or under SARA) or provincially as species of conservation concern.  

There are no fish species listed with COSEWIC or under SARA that are known to be found within the House 
River sub-basin near the pipeline route. However, provincially-listed fish species (i.e., listed as May be at 
Risk or Sensitive) and sportfish may be found in watercourses near or crossed by the pipeline route 
(Table 5.7.1). Some fish species that may be found near the pipeline route are provincially-listed as 
Undetermined due to “...insufficient information, knowledge or data to determine status” (ASRD 2011a). 
Arctic grayling and northern redbelly dace are listed as Sensitive. Sensitive species are those that “...are 
not at risk of extinction or extirpation however, may require special attention or protection to prevent it from 
becoming at risk” (ASRD 2011a). The status of species known to occur within the House River sub-basin 
are identified in Table 5.7.1. 

Although Alberta considers northern pike and walleye to be Secure (ASRD 2010), both species have 
experienced severe population declines throughout most of their range, therefore, Alberta has implemented 
management and recovery plans (Berry 1995, 1999). Population declines associated with angler 
overharvest and habitat degradation are cited in these management plans as key factors that have led to 
the decline of these species.  

Arctic grayling are listed as Sensitive in Alberta (ASRD 2010) and occur throughout portions of the 
Athabasca, Hay, and Peace River basins (Nelson and Paetz 1992). Arctic grayling populations in Alberta 
are high priority candidates for a detailed status assessment by COSEWIC (COSEWIC 2014a). Alberta has 
implemented a management and recovery plan for Arctic grayling (Berry 1998). Population declines, 
particularly in the southern portions of their range in Alberta, are often attributed to pollution, habitat 
degradation, fragmentation, increasing water temperatures and overharvest by anglers (ASRD 2005, 
Berry 1998). Additional information about Arctic grayling distribution and habitat requirements is provided 
in Appendix 3. 

Northern pikeminnow are listed as Sensitive (ASRD 2010) in Alberta and occur within the Peace River 
drainage system (Nelson and Paetz 1992). The presence of northern pikeminnow during the proposed 
construction activities is not likely at any of the proposed watercourse crossings. Additional information 
about northern pikeminnow distribution and habitat requirements is provided in Appendix 3. 

Northern redbelly dace are listed as Sensitive in Alberta (ASRD 2010) and occur throughout portions of the 
Athabasca, Hay, Peace, North and South Saskatchewan, Oldman and Milk River basins (Nelson and 
Paetz 1992). There is no management plan for northern redbelly dace populations in Alberta. Additional 
information about Northern redbelly dace distribution and habitat requirements is provided in Appendix 3. 

Spoonhead sculpin are found throughout the Slave, Peace, Athabasca and North Saskatchewan River 
basins. They are listed in Alberta as May be at Risk since existing data on the status of populations across 
the province is currently insufficient to designate the species as Secure (Clayton pers. comm.) Spoonhead 
sculpin populations in Alberta are mid priority candidates for a detailed status assessment by COSEWIC 
(COSEWIC 2014a). Since spoonhead sculpin are bottom-feeders and often occur in large rivers, they are 
difficult to capture and study, therefore, basic inventory information on spoonhead sculpin population trends 
in Alberta is lacking. There is no management plan for spoonhead sculpin populations in Alberta. Additional 
information about spoonhead sculpin distribution and habitat requirements is provided in Appendix 3. 

5.7.3 Aquatic Field Program 

An initial desktop assessment identified potential waterbody crossings with fish and fish habitat potential 
along the proposed route. Watercourse crossings with defined bed and banks were assessed in the field 
during the open water season in July and August 2013. A subsequent field visit occurred in May 2014, to 
assess potential drainages that were not observed during the initial desktop assessment and helicopter 
flyover. The open water assessments involved an aquatic habitat assessment and a fish inventory at each 
watercourse crossing.

NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd.  Environmental and Socio-Economic Assessment 
Liege Lateral Loop 2 – Thornbury Section Pipeline and 
the Leismer East Compressor Station Project 

September 2014 / 496955/492475 

 
Open water aquatic assessments were conducted in July and August 2013 and May 2014 at all 
watercourses and fish-bearing drainage crossings. There were eight proposed watercourse crossings, four 
fish-bearing drainages (i.e., two confirmed fish-bearing drainages and two potentially fish-bearing 
drainages), and six nonfish-bearing drainages identified along the proposed crossings. Of the eight 
watercourse crossings, five are unnamed tributaries of Dropoff Creek (WC1, WC2, WC3, WC4, WC5), one 
is on Dropoff Creek (WC6), one is an unnamed tributary of the House River (WC7) and one is the House 
River (WC8). Of the 18 proposed watercourse/drainages assessed, 9 were determined to be fish-bearing 
and 9 were determined to be nonfish-bearing. 

For an adjacent proposed NGTL pipeline route, open water aquatic assessments were conducted by TERA 
in September 2012 and May 2013 and winter aquatic habitat investigations were conducted in 
February 2013 (TERA 2014a). Results from the aquatic studies on the adjacent route were within or near 
the study reaches of three of the Project’s watercourse crossings (i.e., WC6, WC7 and WC8) and one of 
the Project’s fish-bearing drainage crossing (i.e., FD4). These four crossings were still visited on the ground 
for the Project in summer 2013 to verify the previous results as well as collect necessary additional fish and 
fish habitat information as determined by the Qualified Aquatics Environment Specialist (QAES). Data from 
the previous assessments at these four crossings that were determined by the QAES to be relevant to the 
Project’s crossings are included in Appendix 3.   

Winter habitat investigations were not conducted for the Project due to an adequate amount of existing 
winter habitat data from TERA (2014a) and the lack of potentially important wintering habitat at the 
remaining waterbody crossings. Refer to Appendix 3 for additional details on the open water aquatic habitat 
assessment, open water fish inventory and winter aquatic habitat assessment (e.g., sampling 
methodologies). 

5.7.4 Crossings of Fish-Bearing Waterbodies 

Fish were captured in 7 of the 18 watercourses/drainages  (i.e., WC4, WC5, WC6, WC7, WC8, FD3, FD4) 
along the pipeline route. Two unnamed and potentially fish-bearing drainages (FD1 and FD2) could not be 
sampled for fish during the May 2014 assessment due to ice cover, therefore, these drainages are assumed 
to be fish-bearing for the purpose of the assessment and have been included in Table 5.7.2, although no 
species have been previously documented (FWMIS 2014). The following subsection provides the 
fish-bearing watercourses and drainages crossed by the pipeline route, including fish captured and 
historically documented as well as applicable restricted activity periods (RAPs). Additional information 
about each fish-bearing crossing, including recommended crossing methods, water quality parameters, 
watercourse characteristics, fish habitat potential ratings and instream RAPs is provided in Appendix 3.  

Fish-bearing drainages lack defined beds and banks and, therefore, do not fall under the Code of Practice 
(COP) in Alberta and have no classification or RAP. However, if sportfish are present, species-specific 
RAPs may be applicable, at the discretion of the QAES. See Appendix 3 for details

5.8 Wetlands 

This subsection presents a summary of the findings related to loss or alteration of wetland function within 
the Wetland LSA and RSA (Figure 5.5).  

The potential Project-related effects and key mitigation pertaining to wetlands are discussed in Section 6.2.8 
and full mitigation measures are provided in the EPP (Appendix 1). A detailed discussion regarding the 
existing condition of wetlands is available in Appendix 6. 

The Wetland LSA consists of a 400 m wide band centred on the pipeline right-of-way centre line (i.e., 200 m 
on both sides of the centre line) and a 200 m band around the perimeter of the compressor station boundary. 
The Wetland RSA (Figure 5.5) is defined as a 30 km wide band centred on the construction right-of-way 
(i.e., 15 km on both sides of the construction right-of-way centreline). The Wetland LSA and RSA are 
described in greater detail in Section 6.2.8, including the rationale for the determination of these boundaries.

NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd.  Environmental and Socio-Economic Assessment 
Liege Lateral Loop 2 – Thornbury Section Pipeline and 
the Leismer East Compressor Station Project 

September 2014 / 496955/492475 

 
Wetlands are defined as follows: 

“…land that is saturated with water long enough to promote wetland or aquatic processes as 
indicated by poorly-drained soils, hydrophytic vegetation and various kinds of biological activity 
which are adapted to a wet environment.” (National Wetland Working Group [NWWG] 1997). 

This wetland definition encompasses a wide range of ecosystems, from fens, bogs and swamps 
(i.e., mossy-peat to woody-peat ecosystems) to marshes and shallow open water (i.e., mineral and open 
water ecosystems). Wetlands include a broad range of ecosystem classes, from those permanently flooded 
by shallow water and dominated by aquatic organisms to forested sites with merely moist soils. 

Wetland function can be described as the ability of wetlands to provide or perform numerous habitat, 
hydrological and biogeochemical aspects within an ecosystem. These functions include flood control, 
groundwater recharge, water quality functions, such as water purification, sediment and nutrient retention, 
carbon sequestration, substrate protection and maintaining biodiversity. Seasonal variability exists among 
wetland function, but can also differ from year to year (e.g., times of drought or excessive precipitation). As 
a result, the proportions to which wetlands can perform these various functions are constantly changing. A 
literature review summary for wetland function and a description of wetland function conditions can be found 
in Appendix 6, as well as the methods used to evaluate wetland function. 

Wetlands along the Project were initially identified through satellite imagery interpretation using key 
indicators such as terrain, surficial material (i.e., mineral soils or organic peats), vegetation cover and the 
presence or absence of surficial hydrology. Wetland classifications and delineations were confirmed and 
wetland data was collected during the June 4, 2013 and May 6, 2014 helicopter reconnaissance and 
helicopter-supported ground-based wetland surveys.  

The helicopter reconnaissance was used to gather high-level delineation and classification information for 
wetlands encountered by the Project. Helicopter-supported ground-based wetland surveys were conducted 
to gather detailed information on the various wetland classes along the pipeline route. 

The functional condition of representative wetland classes crossed by the pipeline route (i.e., construction 
right-of-way) is reported on the premise that disturbed wetlands will be revisited in the years following 
construction to document the progress of function returning to wetland ecosystems. Wetland function 
documented during the existing (i.e., pre-construction) condition ground-based wetland surveys will be 
compared to wetland function observed along the reclaimed (i.e., post-construction) construction right-of-
way for each class of wetland crossed by the pipeline route. Helicopter overflights will be conducted post-
construction for wetland ecologists to obtain a visual overview of the reclaimed wetland ecosystems so they 
can determine if wetland function processes are being impeded (e.g., impoundment of water) within and 
adjacent to the construction right-of-way, as well as remotely from the area of disturbance. The results of 
this comparison will be used to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of mitigation and reclamation 
measures and to ensure that wetlands are on the trajectory of returning to pre-construction functional 
conditions. A determination of “no net loss” of wetland function will be supported by these findings. Data 
collection methods are based on the Wisconsin Rapid Assessment Methodology (Wisconsin Department 
of Natural Resources 2001); the Manual for the Wetland Ecosystem Services Protocol for the US 
(Adamus 2011); the Riparian Health Assessment for Lakes Sloughs and Wetlands (Ambrose et al. 2009); 
the Riparian Health Assessment for Streams and Small Rivers (Fitch et al. 2001); and the Ontario Wetland 
Evaluation System (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources 2013) and are part of an Environment Canada 
recommended approach (Hanson et al. 2008).  

5.8.1 Wetland Setting  

Alberta represents approximately 7% of Canada’s land mass. Wetlands in Alberta cover approximately 20% 
of the province; over 90% of which are peatlands in the boreal region, while the remaining 10% are mineral 
wetlands (i.e., marshes, swamps and shallow open water wetlands) in the parkland and prairie region (Vitt 
et al. 1996, NWWG 1986, Tarnocai 1984). 

The Project is located entirely within the Continental High Boreal Wetland Region (Government of Canada 
1986). In the Continental High Boreal Wetland Region, flat bogs and basin bogs are commonly associated

this wetland region is 2 to 3 m. Marshes can also be found along gently sloping lakeshores (Government 
of Canada 1986). 

The Project is located within the Central Mixedwood and Lower Boreal Highlands Natural subregions of the 
Boreal Forest Natural Region where wetland distribution is approximately 25 to 40% (Natural Regions 
Committee 2006). The Central Mixedwood Natural Subregion consists of predominately aspen, mixedwood 
and white spruce forests on uplands, with jack pine stands on coarser materials to the east. Within this 
subregion, wetlands are a dominant component of the landscape. Common wetland classes in this 
subregion include treed fens on organic deposits (i.e., peat) and marshes on wet mineral soils. Many small 
lakes occur within this subregion (Natural Regions Committee 2006). Wetland distribution within this 
subregion varies from 10 to 60% depending on the site location (NRCan 2009g).  

Landscapes in the Lower Boreal Highlands Natural Subregion are characterized by diverse mixedwood 
forests on moist lower slopes of northern hill systems and extensive wetlands at slope bases and on 
adjacent lowlands. Forests are a mix of aspen, balsam poplar, black spruce, white spruce, white birch with 
hybrids of lodgepole pine and jack pine occurring specifically on slopes. Treed, shrubby or graminoid fens 
occur in depressions, seepage zones or level areas. The Lower Boreal Highlands Natural Subregion has 
slightly colder winters and warmer summers than the higher elevation Upper Boreal Highlands Natural 
Subregion and is moister and cooler than the adjacent Central Mixedwood and Dry Mixedwood Natural 
Subregions. Common soils are Gray Luvisols (often gleyed) with Organic soils and Gleysols in the wetlands 
(Natural Regions Committee 2006). 

The Project is not located within or adjacent to any Important Bird Areas, Migratory Bird Sanctuaries, 
National Wildlife Areas, Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserves, Ramsar Wetlands of International 
Importance or World Biosphere Reserves (Alberta Tourism, Parks and Recreation [ATPR] 2013a, Bird 
Studies Canada and Nature Canada 2012, Environment Canada 2013, Western Hemisphere Shorebird 
Reserve Network 2012, Bureau of the Convention on Wetlands 2014, United Nations Educational, Scientific 
and Cultural Organization 2014). 

Ducks Unlimited Canada (DUC) has identified three levels of priority for wetland conservation in Canada. 
Priority areas are threatened landscapes identified for conservation in order to provide a healthier 
environment for waterfowl. The Project is located in the DUC Western Boreal Forest Level 1 Priority 
Landscape Area. The Western Boreal Forest supports populations of 11 to 15 million waterfowl that use 
the area for breeding, migration, moulting and staging. This region serves as one of two primary breeding 
areas for waterfowl in North America (DUC 2013). 

As noted, there are four AESAs that are encountered by the pipeline route component of the Project. 
(Table 5.3.1) (Fiera 2010a). Detailed information is provided in Table 5.3.1and Appendices 3 and 6.  

Land use encountered by the Project is predominantly forest. Wetlands encountered by the Project were 
found to be disturbed by resource extraction activities, such as forestry, seismic lines, pipeline rights-of-
way and other infrastructure (e.g., roads, transmission lines and well sites).  

5.8.2 Wetland Classification 

All wetlands encountered by the Project were classified according to the Canadian Wetland Classification 
System (CWCS) (NWWG 1997). The CWCS serves as a practical guide for the characterization and 
description of wetlands encountered in Canada (NWWG 1988, 1997) and can be applied throughout all 
regions of the country. To better describe wetlands typical of the boreal forest in Alberta, Kershaw (2009) 
slightly modified the CWCS. Detailed information on wetland classes and types commonly occurring in the 
vicinity of the Project, including the definition for each wetland class, can be found in Appendix 6. 

5.8.3 Wetland Field Results 

Helicopter reconnaissance was conducted along the pipeline route on June 4, 2013 and again on May 6, 
2014 with the compressor station location. Helicopter-supported ground-based wetland surveys were 
conducted at eight representative wetlands crossed by the proposed construction right-of-way.

September 2014 / 496955/492475 

 
A combination of wetland field work results, a desktop review of overflight photographs and satellite imagery 
interpretation was used to identify and delineate wetlands crossed by the proposed pipeline route. A total 
of 21 wetlands (totalling approximately 20.3 km in length), comprising approximately 54.9% of the pipeline 
route, were identified. Wetlands crossed by the proposed construction right-of-way include 11 treed fens, 1 
shrubby fen, 4 mixedwood treed swamps, 3 shrubby swamps, 1 deep marsh and 1 seasonal emergent 
marsh. The shrubby fen, deep marsh seasonal emergent marsh and one of the mixedwood treed swamps 
have been modified by beaver activity. The shrubby fen, two of the mixedwood treed swamps and one of 
the treed fens are associated with watercourses or fish-bearing drainages (Appendix 6). The terrain along 
the proposed pipeline route includes extensive treed fens. The remainder of the route is undulating forest 
with existing disturbances such as cut blocks, existing pipeline rights-of-way, winter access roads and lease 
sites. When such disturbances occur in moist forest, they may be quite wet due to the water table, even 
though they are not classed as wetlands due to their lack of hydric soils. More information on wetlands is 
included in the wetland report for this Project. 

No wetlands were identified within 30 m of the proposed compressor station boundaries. 

Wetland functional assessments were conducted at all wetlands where helicopter-supported ground-based 
surveys were conducted in 2013 and 2014 along the pipeline route. The results of these assessments 
identified that seven representative wetlands were considered to be of High Functional Condition and one 
is of High-Moderate Functional Condition. Detailed information on the wetland function assessment criteria 
can be found in Appendix 6. 

A summary of wetland classification and abundance along the pipeline route is provided in Table 5.8.1. 
Additional information on wetlands along the pipeline route is provided in Appendix 6.

5.8.4 Local and Traditional Ecological Knowledge 

Oily patches have recently been found by Aboriginal community members in muskeg areas and are 
believed to be caused by water coming into contact with existing subsurface pipelines. Community 
members have observed that water from muskeg areas is being converted to steam power at oil and gas 
plants, or is draining into underground areas that once contained oil. This is thought to have caused the top 
layer of the muskeg to dry out in some areas, and result in less available water for wildlife and vegetation. 

Full results of the wetlands TEK collected including issues and concerns related to wetland resources as 
well as proposed mitigation measures and/or responses to those issues are compiled in Appendix 10.  

5.9 Vegetation 

This subsection presents a summary the vegetation, including abundance and distribution of vegetation 
species and communities of ecological importance in the Vegetation LSA and RSA (Figure 5.6). 

The potential effects related to the construction and operations of the Project and mitigation pertaining to 
vegetation are discussed in Section 6.2.9. The potential effects on vegetation in the context of human health 
are discussed in Section 6.2.16 and full mitigation measures are provided in the EPP (Appendix 1).

affected by construction and/or operations of the Project are identified on the Environmental Alignment 
Sheets (Appendix 2) and a detailed discussion regarding the existing condition of vegetation resources is 
provided in Appendix 7. 

The Vegetation LSA is defined as a 400 m wide band centred on the pipeline route right-of-way centre line 
(i.e., 200 m on both sides of the centre line) and a 200 m buffer around the perimeter of the compressor 
station. The Vegetation RSA consists of a 5 km wide band centred on the pipeline route right-of-way centre 
line (i.e., 2.5 km on both sides of the centre line) and a 2.5 km buffer around the perimeter of the compressor 
station. The Vegetation LSA and RSA are described in greater detail in Section 6.2.9, including the rationale 
for the determination of these boundaries.

5.9.1 Ecosystem Classification 

Alberta ecosystems are identified as Natural Regions and Subregions in which the Project crosses the 
Central Mixedwood Natural Subregion and the Lower Boreal Highlands Natural Subregion (Natural Regions 
Committee 2006).  

The Central Mixedwood Natural Subregion is the largest natural subregion in Alberta and is characterized 
by upland forests and wetlands on level to gently undulating plains. Upland forests are a mosaic of aspen, 
mixedwood and white spruce. Common understory species include: low-bush cranberry; prickly rose; green 
alder; Canada buffaloberry; hairy wild rye; bunchberry; wild sarsaparilla; and dewberry. Jack pine stands 
occur on coarser materials. Wetlands are often extensive and are dominated by black spruce fens and bogs 
(Natural Regions Committee 2006). 

Landscapes in the Lower Boreal Highlands Natural Subregion are characterized by diverse mixedwood 
forests on moist lower slopes of northern hill systems and extensive wetlands at slope bases and on 
adjacent lowlands. Forests are a mix of aspen, balsam poplar, black spruce, white spruce and white birch 
with hybrids of lodgepole pine and jack pine occurring on slopes. Treed, shrubby or graminoid fens occur 
in depressions, seepage zones or level areas. This subregion has slightly colder winters and warmer 
summers than the higher-elevation Upper Boreal Highlands Natural Subregion and is moister and cooler 
than the adjacent Central Mixedwood and Dry Mixedwood natural subregions (Natural Regions 
Committee 2006). 

Vegetation surveys were conducted at select locations along the Project right-of-way from 
July23 to 25, 2013 and June 1, 2013. Additional vegetation surveys were conducted on July 4 to 9, 2014. 
The vegetation surveys encountered a number of different vegetation communities, primarily coniferous 
forest, deciduous forest, mixedwood forest, treed fens, bogs and riparian areas. 

Coniferous forests observed during the surveys were dominated by black spruce or Jack pine, or black 
spruce with tamarack. Dominant understory species included common Labrador tea, common blueberry, 
bunchberry and cloudberry. Peat moss species and reindeer lichens were also often present (Plate 1; all 
plates are in Appendix C). 

Deciduous forests observed during the vegetation surveys primarily consisted of aspen and Alaska birch. 
Dominant understory species included prickly rose, wild red raspberry, beaked willow and bracted 
honeysuckle. Stair-step moss and Schreber’s moss were also often present (Plate 2). 

Mixedwood forests observed during the surveys were dominated by trembling aspen, balsam poplar and 
white spruce. Common understory species included low-bush cranberry, Canada buffaloberry, common 
Labrador tea, prickly rose and northern gooseberry. In moister areas, additional understory species 
included river alder and willow species. Knight’s plume moss, stair-step moss, Schreber’s moss and 
reindeer lichens were also often present (Plate 3).  

Treed fens observed during the vegetation surveys were generally dominated by black spruce canopies 
and balsam fir. Common Labrador tea, narrow spinulose shield fern, star-flowered Solomon’s-seal and 
two-seeded sedge were common understory species observed in treed fens (Plate 4). Occasionally, treed 
fens were dominated by shrubby willow species and aspen and the dominant understory species included 
dwarf raspberry, marsh-marigold, marsh cinquefoil, swamp horsetail and few-flowered sedge. 

Riparian areas are transitional between uplands and wetlands. These areas contained vegetation similar 
to that of the treed fens. Additional species encountered in riparian areas included short sedges and fowl 
bluegrass (Plate 5). 

The compressor station is dominated by mature black spruce and Labrador tea coniferous forest. Parallel 
to the western edge there is a narrow existing cutline which is dominated by young deciduous trees and 
shrubs and a wide linear disturbance which is currently open soil. The northern portion of the access road 
is dominated by young growth of black spruce and graminoid species. The area is wet, however, this is 
likely in response to past clearing and fire of what was previously a coniferous forested area (similar to that 
which is on the compressor station site to the south).

A list of all species observed during the surveys is provided in Appendix 7. Species nomenclature is 
according to the list of all elements in Alberta (ACIMS 2013c), with more current taxonomic information 
drawn from NatureServe (2014), when necessary. 

5.9.2 Environmentally Significant Areas 

The Vegetation RSA encounters two Environmentally Significant Areas, as defined by ATPR (ATPR 2009). 

The ATPR defines Environmentally Significant Areas as areas in Alberta that are important to the long-term 
maintenance of biological diversity, soil, water or other natural processes, at multiple spatial scales and/or 
areas that contain rare or unique elements or that include elements that may require special management 
consideration due to their conservation needs. However, ATPR also states that the Environmentally 
Significant Areas do not represent government policy and do not necessarily require legal protection. They 
are intended to be an information tool to help inform land use planning and policy at local, regional and 
provincial scales (ATPR 2009). There are two Environmentally Significant Areas located within the 
Vegetation RSA (i.e., 2.5 km on both sides of the pipeline centre line) (Table 5.9.1) (Fiera 2009). Of these 
two areas, one is of provincial significance and the other is of national significance. Environmentally 
Significant Areas may contain important vegetation resources as they often contain large natural areas, 
intact riparian areas, rare or unique landforms and elements of conservation concern that may include rare 
vascular and non-vascular vegetation, and rare vegetation communities (Fiera 2009). Environmentally 
Significant Area 593 is located within Vegetation RSA and is of Provincial significance which was 
designated as a result of it containing rare or unique landforms. There are no elements related to vegetation 
noted within this area. Additionally, Environmentally Significant Area 692 is also within the Vegetation RSA 
and is of National significance. This area covers 6,673 km² and contains 70 elements of conservation 
concern of which 62 are plant species (34 vascular plants, 18 mosses and 10 liverworts) and 2 are rare 
ecological communities.

six major rivers). 

• Contains large natural areas.

5.9.3 Land Use 

The Project is located entirely on Crown-owned lands in a forested setting within the Green Area of Alberta. 
Lands crossed by the Project Footprint consist primarily of a native vegetation with intermittent areas of 
anthropogenic usage (e.g., pipelines, roads, etc.).

September 2014 / 496955/492475 

 
5.9.4 Timber 

The Project area mainly consists of burned lands from a 10+ year old burn that was likely part of the 2002 
House River Forest Fire. The fire resulted in a wide distribution of fens and bogs (i.e., muskeg), as well as 
sparsely fragmented forests stands (Bergeron et al. 2002). Fire induced regenerating aspen is the dominant 
vegetation community within the burned areas.  

5.9.5 Rare Plants and Rare Ecological Communities 

ACIMS provided records of rare plant occurrences known the Vegetation RSA (i.e., 2.5 km on both sides 
of the centre line) and a 2.5 km buffer around the perimeter of the compressor station), which included one 
rare vascular plant species and one rare moss species (ATPR 2013a). Details of the previously recorded 
occurrences are summarized in Table 1 and shown on Figure 2 in Appendix 7. No rare ecological 
communities are known to occur within 5 km of the pipeline route (ATPR 2013a). 

There was one ACIMS-listed rare vascular plant species and eight ACIMS-listed rare non-vascular plant 
species observed along the proposed pipeline route during the Project-specific vegetation surveys. No 
ACIMS-listed rare ecological communities were observed within the LSA. The rare plants observed along 
the pipeline construction right-of-way and compressor station Footprint are summarized in Table 5.9.2. 
Details regarding the location and abundance of each rare plant population are provided in Appendix 7. 
Baeomyces carneus is not listed in Alberta; it is Red-listed and ranked S1 in British Columbia 
(NatureServe 2013). However, recent taxonomic information suggests that Baeomyces carneus is probably 
not rare in northern Alberta and in the Rockies, but is often overlooked due to its frequently sterile condition 
(Björk pers. comm.). 

Vegetation surveys were conducted at select locations along the Project from July 23 to 25, 2013 and again 
from July 4 to 9, 2014.  

No ACIMS-listed rare ecological communities were observed during the surveys conducted along the 
proposed Project.

Note: 1 Definitions of rarity ranks are included in Appendix 7. 
 

5.9.6 Non-Native and Invasive Species 

Weeds of management concern identified in the Alberta Weed Control Regulation were reviewed. 
Representatives from the RM of Wood Buffalo and Lac La Biche County were contacted to identify site and 
county-specific weed and crop disease concerns as well as recommended mitigation measures. 

The weeds of concern in the RM of Wood Buffalo are those that are provincially listed and priorities for 
weeds in the RM include the cleaning of equipment prior to arrival and the seeding of disturbed lands to 
prevent weed establishment (Stone pers. comm.).

NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd.  Environmental and Socio-Economic Assessment 
Liege Lateral Loop 2 – Thornbury Section Pipeline and 
the Leismer East Compressor Station Project 

September 2014 / 496955/492475 

 
Weeds of concern in Lac La Biche County include scentless chamomile, oxeye daisy, Canada thistle 
(creeping thistle) and common tansy (Beniuk pers. comm.). 

No Prohibited Noxious weeds were observed along the proposed route. There were three Noxious weeds 
observed along the proposed route: Canada thistle (creeping thistle); common tansy; and scentless 
chamomile. The following non-listed, non-native species also occur along the proposed route: alsike clover; 
annual hawk's-beard; awnless brome; bird’s-foot trefoil; common dandelion; common plantain; quack grass; 
red clover; rough cinquefoil; timothy; white sweet-clover; and yellow sweet-clover. The abundance of weedy 
species is currently low and limited to areas of previous disturbance. 

A list of all species observed at the time of surveys, including weeds, is provided in Appendix 7. Where 
Alberta Weed Control Act nomenclature differs from the ACIMS list of all elements (ACIMS 2013c), the 
Weed Control Act name for the species has been provided in brackets following the ACIMS name. Weed 
location and abundance data are presented in Appendix E. The density classes presented in Appendix 7 
follow the density distribution guide provided in the AESRD Rangeland Health Assessment Guide 
(Adams et al. 2009). 

5.9.7 Forest Pests 

The Project is situated within a Leading Edge Zone as part of the Alberta Mountain Pine Beetle 
Management Strategy (ASRD 2011b, 2012a). The prime objective of the Leading Edge Zone is to reduce 
and maintain Mountain Pine Beetle (MPB) populations and spread to an endemic level (ASRD 2007). If 
MPB-infested pine is to be harvested from the Project area, refer to the Alberta Mountain Pine Beetle Log 
Management Directive (ASRD 2011b) for requirements and restrictions on hauling, storage and disposal 
of timber and residue. 

In discussion with AESRD, it was determined that MPB was not a concern for this area.  

No symptoms of forest pests (e.g., defoliation, leaf discolouration) were observed during the vegetation 
surveys (Appendix 7).  

5.9.8 Local and Traditional Knowledge 

Participants expressed concerns about effects to medicinal plants 1.1 m northeast of KP 12.1, 8.9 m 
southwest of KP 21.9 and 192.9 m north of KP 35.1, as well as concerns about impacts on wildlife habitat 
at 5.6 m north of KP 12.4, and impacts to blueberry harvesting at 43.2 m south of KP 7.7 (Appendix 10). 
Detailed results of vegetation TEK collected, including issues and concerns related to vegetation resources 
and proposed mitigation measures and/or responses to those issues are compiled in the TK Report 
(Appendix 10). 

5.10 Wildlife and Wildlife Habitat 

This subsection summarizes the existing conditions for wildlife and wildlife habitat within the Wildlife LSA 
and RSA (Figure 5.7). It describes the wildlife areas encountered by the Project and the wildlife field work 
conducted in the Wildlife LSA.  

The potential effects and key mitigation pertaining to wildlife and wildlife habitat are discussed in 
Section 6.2.10 and full mitigation measures are provided in the EPP (Appendix 1). Further information is 
available in the wildlife report (Appendix 8). 

The Wildlife LSA consists of the Footprint and adjacent areas of indirect disturbance and is defined as a 
2 km wide band centred on the construction right-of-way (i.e., extending 1 km on both sides of the 
construction right-of-way centre line) and 1 km around the perimeter of the compressor station and access 
road. The spatial boundary for the Wildlife RSA is defined as a 30 km wide band centred on the construction 
right-of-way (i.e., extending 15 km on both sides of the construction right-of-way centre line) and 15 km 
around the perimeter of the compressor station and access road. A Caribou RSA is also defined by the 
Agnes, Algar, Egg-pony caribou herd boundaries within the ESAR caribou range (see Figure 5.7). The 
wildlife study area boundaries are described in greater detail in Section 6.2.10.1, including the rationale for 
the determination of these boundaries.

5.10.1 Wildlife Areas 

5.10.1.1 Provincially Identified Wildlife Areas 

The proposed compressor station, access road and pipeline route are located within the ESAR caribou 
range. The pipeline route crosses through the Egg-Pony herd for a length of 4.9 km from KP 0 to KP 4.9 
and the Algar herd for a length of 18.9 km from KP 14.3 to KP 33.2 (AESRD 2014a). A timing restriction of 
February 15 to July 15 applies for new site preparation and construction within caribou ranges (Government 
of Alberta 2013a). Exceptions to this timing restriction include: site preparation/construction that was 
initiated prior to February 15; activities using Class V roads; and activities within 100 m of an all-weather 
road, providing ground conditions are favorable. Work can continue until adverse ground conditions are 
encountered (Government of Alberta 2013a). 

From KP 34.0 to KP 36.3, the pipeline route crosses a KWBZ associated with the House River for a length 
of 2.3 km (AESRD 2014a). KWBZ were established to protect the integrity of ungulate wintering areas, river 
corridors and biodiversity areas where species tend to concentrate, and have a timing restriction of January 
15 to April 30 (Government of Alberta 2013a). The proposed compressor station location and access road 
are not located within a KWBZ (AESRD 2014a). 

5.10.1.2 Environmentally Significant Areas, Parks and Protected Areas 

The pipeline route is located within a nationally significant Environmentally Significant Area (692) for a 
length of approximately 1.6 km along House River from KP 34.5 to KP 36.1 (ATPR 2009). Environmentally 
Significant Area 692 (Table 5.9.1) contains large natural areas, intact riparian areas, important wildlife 
habitat, including habitat for woodland caribou (Fiera 2009). The pipeline route also crosses four AESAs 
(Fiera 2010a,b). Information about the AESAs is provided in Table 5.3.1. The compressor station and 
access road are not located within an Environmentally Significant Area (ATPR 2009, Fiera 2010a). 

The Project is not located within or adjacent to any Parks or Protected Areas, Important Bird Areas, 
Migratory Bird Sanctuaries, National Wildlife Areas, Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserves, Ramsar 
Wetlands or World Biosphere Reserves (ATPR 2013a, Bird Studies Canada and Nature Canada 2012, 
Environment Canada 2013, Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network 2012, Bureau of the 
Convention on Wetlands 2014, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 2014).  

Protective Notations 
A search of the GLIMPS for wildlife-related Crown dispositions found the Project does not encounter any 
PNTs or other dispositions pertaining to wildlife habitat conservation (Alberta Energy 2014a). 

Lower Athabasca Regional Plan 
The LARP, made public in April 2011 and approved on August 22, 2012, identifies strategic directions over 
a 10 year period to provide guidance to provincial and local decision-makers regarding land use 
management for the region. The LARP contains objectives to manage landscapes to maintain ecosystem 
function and biodiversity. The Project is not located within any proposed Conservation Areas identified in 
the LARP (Government of Alberta 2012a). 

5.10.2 Wildlife Field Work Results 

Summer field work was conducted from June 19 to 26 and 28, 2013 and winter field work was conducted 
from January 16 to 21, 2014. Methods for the wildlife surveys are provided in Appendix 8, and the results 
of the wildlife field work are summarized below.  

5.10.2.1  Mammals 

Ungulates 
Ungulate species and/or their sign (beds, cratering, pellets, tracks) observed during the wildlife field work 
included deer, moose and woodland caribou. Evidence (i.e., pellets, tracks) of deer and moose was 
common along the proposed pipeline route, as well as at the proposed compressor station site and along

the proposed access road. A bull moose was observed during the winter track survey in an area of birch 
and alder regrowth near KP 18.0. An area of deer and moose use (i.e., tracks) was observed during the 
January 2014 winter track survey on the existing pipeline right-of-way from KP 32.8 to KP 33.3. Moose 
tracks were observed along all three winter track transects and the average track density ranged from 0.2 
to 2.7 tracks per km per day. 

Woodland caribou and/or their sign (cratering, pellets, tracks) were observed along the proposed pipeline 
route near KP 3.4 in the Egg-Pony herd caribou range, and between KP 16.2 to KP 19.3, near KP 30.0 and 
KP 31.8 (see Table 5.11.2 for details). No obvious mineral licks were identified on or immediately adjacent 
to the Project location during the wildlife field work. 

Other Mammals 
American black bear (scat, tracks), Canada lynx (tracks), coyote (tracks), fisher (visual), gray wolf (scat, 
tracks) and red fox (tracks) were observed during the wildlife field work.  Evidence of black bear and gray 
wolf was commonly observed along the proposed pipeline route in June 2013. American black bear sign 
(tracks, beds, scat) were observed at the proposed compressor station site in July 2014. Wolf tracks were 
also observed during the winter track survey in areas with ungulate use. 

A fisher (provincially-listed as Sensitive in Alberta) (ASRD 2011c) was observed crossing an existing right-
of-way during the June 2013 field work near KP 23.6. No fisher tracks were observed during the winter 
track survey. 

Canada lynx (provincially-listed as Sensitive) (ASRD 2011c) tracks were identified during the January 2014 
field work in areas associated with high levels of use by snowshoe hare, including mature mixedwood 
forests and areas with regenerating mixedwood stands. Average track densities for Canada lynx ranged 
from 0.2 to 0.4 tracks per km per day.  

American marten (tracks), ermine (tracks), meadow jumping mouse (visual), porcupine (tracks), red squirrel 
(visual, tracks), snowshoe hare (visual, tracks, pellets), woodchuck (visual) and unidentified mouse/vole 
species (tracks) were observed during the June 2013 wildlife field work. 

Meadow jumping mice were observed in long grass on an existing right-of-way near KP 36.1 and the east 
side of the House River near KP 35.4 in June 2013. A woodchuck and den were observed in a mature 
mixedwood forest near KP 35.9, approximately 140 m north of the proposed construction right-of-way, in 
June 2013.  

No other mammal dens were observed on or immediately adjacent to the proposed Project during the June 
2013 wildlife field work. 

American marten and ermine tracks were observed during the winter track survey, most commonly in 
mature coniferous and mixedwood forests as well as areas with regenerating conifer and mixedwood 
stands. Porcupine tracks were observed at two locations, including the riparian area of an unnamed 
tributary to Dropoff Creek near KP 14.7 and with regenerating black spruce near KP 16.8. 

Snowshoe hare, red squirrel and their sign were the most common small mammals identified during the 
winter track survey. Average track densities for snowshoe hare and red squirrel ranged from 1.5 to 9.7 and 
1.3 to 2.1 tracks per km per day, respectively. 

Semi-Aquatic Mammals 
A summary of the beaver activity noted in the fish technical report (Appendix 3) and the wetland evaluation 
(Appendix 6) and during the wildlife field work is presented in Table 5.10.1.

5.10.2.2 Birds 

Passerines 
A total of 50 passerines were recorded during the June 2013 wildlife field work, including two SARA 
Schedule 1 or COSEWIC-listed species: barn swallow; and olive-sided flycatcher (see Table 5.11.2). There 
were seven provincially-listed passerine species that were observed, including Baltimore oriole, 
bay-breasted warbler, Cape May warbler, common yellowthroat, least flycatcher, western tanager and 
western wood-pewee (all listed as Sensitive) (ASRD 2011c). 

Additional warblers observed included: black-and-white warbler; Connecticut warbler; magnolia warbler; 
northern waterthrush; orange-crowned warbler; ovenbird; palm warbler; Tennessee warbler; Wilson’s 
warbler; yellow warbler; and yellow-rumped warbler. Additional sparrows included: chipping sparrow; clay-
colored sparrow; dark-eyed junco; Le Conte’s sparrow; Lincoln’s sparrow; swamp sparrow; and white-
throated sparrow. Vireos included: blue-headed vireo, Philadelphia vireo, red-eyed vireo and warbling vireo.  

During the June 2013 survey, the following eight passerines were observed in the area of the proposed 
compressor station: black-and-white warbler; blue-headed vireo; chipping sparrow; gray jay; hermit thrush; 
palm warbler; white-throated sparrow; and yellow-rumped warbler. 

Species commonly observed during the wildlife field work in January 2014 included black-capped 
chickadee, common raven and gray jay. 

Raptors 
There was one raptor species, sharp-shinned hawk, observed in a mature black spruce stand at 
NW 35-80-14 W4M during the June 2013 wildlife field work. No stick nests were observed on or immediately 
adjacent to the proposed Project. 

No raptors were observed during the January 2014 wildlife field work.

Woodpeckers 
Woodpeckers observed during the wildlife field work in June 2013 included hairy woodpecker, northern 
flicker, pileated woodpecker and three-toed woodpecker. Active yellow-bellied sapsucker nest cavities were 
observed in aspen trees in mature mixedwood stands at KP 34.8 along the House River valley in June 
2013. Snags (standing dead trees) are common in the area affected by the forest fires and in the House 
River valley. 

Woodpeckers observed during the wildlife field work in January 2014 included black-backed woodpecker, 
and pileated woodpecker. Black-backed woodpecker and pileated woodpecker are both provincially-listed 
as Sensitive (ASRD 2011c). There were two pileated woodpeckers and feeding activity were observed in 
an area of mature mixedwood forest near KP 32.8 in January 2014. 

Waterfowl and Shorebirds 
Incidental observations of waterfowl recorded during the June 2013 field work included Canada goose and 
common loon. Waterbirds observed included Bonaparte’s gull, greater yellowlegs, sandhill crane, solitary 
sandpiper and Wilson’s snipe. Sandhill cranes (provincially-listed as Sensitive) (ASRD 2011c) were 
observed at a treed fen at KP 16.8 and KP 32.3. Sandhill crane tracks were observed along an existing 
right-of-way at KP 24.5. Cranes were also heard frequently during the June 2013 wildlife field work, in areas 
of mature mixedwood forest and treed fens. 

Upland Game Birds 
Ruffed grouse, sharp-tailed grouse and spruce grouse were observed during the June 2013 field work. 
Ruffed grouse were heard drumming in mature mixedwood aspen and spruce forest at KP 33.1 and 
KP 35.7, as well as in an aspen and balsam poplar forest at KP 34.1. A sharp-tailed grouse 
(provincially-listed as Sensitive) (ASRD 2011c) was observed in a regenerating forest at KP 23.7. A spruce 
grouse was flushed from an area of treed fen at KP 29.1. Grouse scat was observed in a mature mixedwood 
forest at KP 35.7 and an area of regenerating aspen at KP 20.0. 

Grouse tracks, scat and roosts were observed during the winter track survey in areas of mature coniferous 
and mixedwood forests and regenerating mixedwood. Average tracks densities for grouse ranged from 
0.5 to 1.0 tracks per km per day. 

5.10.2.3 Amphibians 

Amphibians (i.e., adults) identified during the wildlife field work included boreal chorus frog, western toad 
and wood frog. Wood frogs were commonly observed in mature mixedwood forest and treed fens. Boreal 
chorus frogs were observed in a treed fen located off the pipeline route near KP 1.2 and KP 1.5. 

Three adult western toads (Special Concern on Schedule 1 of SARA and by COSEWIC) were observed as 
described below. 

• In a mature mixedwood forest along the proposed trenched contingency route option near the House 
River (and approximately 22 m north of the proposed trenchless route option near KP 35.6).  

• In a treed fen located approximately 80 m north of the proposed pipeline route near KP 35.8.  

• During the aquatics field work located approximately 80 m north of the proposed pipeline route near 
KP 14.8 in a beaver pond associated with the unnamed tributary to Dropoff Creek. The proposed 
pipeline crossing location of the unnamed tributary to Dropoff Creek at KP 14.6 is not suitable western 
toad breeding habitat. 

No amphibian eggs or tadpoles were observed during the wildlife field work, and no western toad breeding 
ponds were identified.

5.10.3 Traditional Ecological Knowledge 

Lands within the wildlife and wildlife habitat RSA were described as ideal habitat for a variety of wildlife 
species. Participants on other field studies identified evidence of deer, elk, moose, caribou, gray wolf, timber 
wolf, lynx, marten, mink, woodchuck, beaver, weasel, and bird species including osprey, eagle, hawks, 
ptarmigan, and grouse. Community members reported that wildlife populations are generally decreasing in 
the region because of ongoing industrial development. Evidence of a well-used game trail was identified 
153.3 m north of KP 34.7. 

Deer, elk, moose and caribou are an important food source for Aboriginal people. Moose prefer wetland 
habitat that offers protection from predators and biting insects, and is abundant in willow and poplar; willow 
comprises a large part of the diet of moose. Participants expressed concerns about the moose population 
decline and the general health of ungulates, which are beginning to appear less healthy and generally 
smaller in size. According to participants, moose populations in the area are declining as a result of greater 
backcountry access via seismic lines, access roads and pipelines. Participants report that deer populations 
in urban areas have grown over the last several years and speculate that this is due to an increase in 
development and cut lines. One participant recalled that it was difficult to find deer when he was young, but 
they now walk right into town. 

Caribou activity, including fur and tracks, was observed by participants 28.2 m southwest of KP 30 and 
17.6 m south of KP 16.2. Caribou are well-adapted to muskeg areas and have very large hooves in 
proportion to the size of their body. This allows them to walk on top of the muskeg and prevents them from 
sinking through the peat moss. Caribou eat white lichen and have a distinctive way of running which appears 
rather clumsy. They are a preferred prey species of wolves, which are capable of consuming them in their 
entirety. 

According to participants, beavers trapped and skinned in the area have been found to have black veins, 
possibly due to the presence of contaminants in the water. Rabbits that live in close proximity to human 
habitations often develop black lumps on their flesh, therefore, making them unpleasant to eat. 

Detailed results of wildlife TEK collected, including issues and concerns related to wildlife resources and 
proposed mitigation measures and/or responses to those issues are compiled in the TK Report 
(Appendix 10).  

5.10.4 Wildlife of Ecological, Human and Economic Importance 

All wildlife species, including those with relatively abundant local and regional populations, can be 
considered ecologically important since they contribute to the function of the ecosystem. For the purposes 
of assessment and developing mitigation to reduce potential effects of the Project, ecologically important 
species and habitats are considered to include those with species conservation status, and are summarized 
in Table 5.11.2 and in Appendix A of Appendix 8. These wildlife species and their habitats are also 
considered to be of human importance since society typically places high value on species with 
conservation concern.  

The wildlife species of human and economic importance that are likely to occur in the Wildlife RSA includes 
those that are hunted or trapped. Species harvested within Wildlife Management Unit (WMU) 519 (Algar 
Lake) and WMU 511 (Crow Lake) include mule deer, white-tailed deer, moose, black bear, cougar, wolf, 
coyote, ruffed grouse, spruce grouse, sharp-tailed grouse, ptarmigan, pheasant, gray partridge, coots, 
common snipe, snow goose, Ross’s goose, Canada goose, white-fronted goose and ducks (Government 
of Alberta 2013b). 

5.11 Species at Risk 

5.11.1 Aquatic Species at Risk 

As noted in Section 5.3, there are no fish species listed with COSEWIC or under SARA that are known to 
be found within the House River sub-basin near the proposed pipeline route. However, provincially-listed 
fish species (i.e., May be at Risk or Sensitive) and sportfish may be found in watercourses near or crossed 
by the pipeline route (Table 5.7.1). Some fish species that may be found near the proposed pipeline route

are provincially-listed as Undetermined due to “...insufficient information, knowledge or data to determine 
status” (ASRD 2011a). Arctic grayling and northern redbelly dace are listed as Sensitive. Sensitive species 
are those that “...are not at risk of extinction or extirpation however, may require special attention or 
protection to prevent it from becoming at risk” (ASRD 2011a). Spoonhead sculpin is listed as May be at 
Risk, indicating that it may be at risk of extinction or extirpation and is a candidate for a detailed status 
assessment (ASRD 2011c). Species known to occur within the House River sub-basin are identified in 
Table 5.7.1. 

5.11.2 Vegetation Species at Risk 

As noted in Section 5.9, ACIMS provided records of rare plant occurrences known the Vegetation RSA  
(i.e., 2.5 km on both sides of the centre line) and a 2.5 km buffer around the perimeter of the compressor 
station),which included one rare vascular plant species and one rare moss species (ATPR 2013a). Details 
of the previously recorded occurrences are summarized in Table 1 and shown on Figure 2 in Appendix 7. 
No rare ecological communities are known to occur within Vegetation RSA (ATPR 2013a). 

Vegetation surveys were conducted along the Project from July 23 to 25, 2013 and again from  
July 4 to 9, 2014.  

No ACIMS-listed rare ecological communities were observed during the surveys conducted along the 
Project. 

5.11.3 Wildlife Species with Conservation Status  

5.11.3.1 Provincial Database 

A search of the FWMIS database identified two occurrences of wildlife species with special conservation 
status within 1 km of the pipeline route: woodland caribou; and common yellowthroat (Table 5.11.1) 
(AESRD 2014a). No occurrences within 1 km of the compressor station location or associated access road 
have been recorded (AESRD 2014a).

Little Brown Myotis (Endangered by COSEWIC): During the summer, reproductive females form maternity 
colonies, typically in buildings and large tree hollows. Adult males and non-reproductive females often roost 
alone or in small groups in buildings, trees, rock crevices, wood piles and caves. Bats may have several 
roost trees that they occupy (Olson 2011). Foraging often occurs in open fields or over waterbodies and 
streams that have a high abundance of aquatic insects (Anthony and Kunz 1977). Winter hibernacula are 
known to occur in caves and abandoned mines where temperatures stay above freezing and humidity is 
high (Fenton and Barclay 1980).  

Northern Myotis (Endangered by COSEWIC): The northern myotis is often associated with the boreal forest. 
During the summer, northern myotis occupy a variety of roosts, often favouring tree cavities, however, also 
roosting in buildings (active and abandoned) and under bark (Caceres and Barclay 2000). Reproductive 
females form small (< 60 individuals) maternity colonies in trees and buildings, and adult males and non-
reproductive females roost alone away from maternity colonies (Caceres and Barclay 2000). Hunting 
typically occurs over small ponds, forest clearings and forest edges, however, has also been observed to 
be concentrated in the understory of non-riparian habitat, which may be a reflection of a gleaning strategy 
(Brack and Whitaker 2001). Like most bats in Alberta, northern myotis hibernate in large groups over winter 
and hibernacula are typically located in caves and abandoned mines where the temperature is continuously 
above freezing and humidity is high (Caceres and Barclay 2000).  

Wolverine (Special Concern by COSEWIC): Wolverines require large, undisturbed treed and treeless areas 
at all elevations that contain an abundance of large ungulate prey (COSEWIC 2003, Environment 
Canada 2014c). Wolverines use a wide assortment of structural stages in their day-to-day life, although 
mature and old forest structural stages are used predominately. Habitat for wolverine is not easily 
delineated as a set of vegetative parameters and is closely tied to the distribution and abundance of food 
as well as suitable habitat/structures for denning (Petersen 1997).  

Woodland Caribou (Threatened on Schedule 1 of the SARA and by COSEWIC): Woodland caribou use a 
combination of peatland/muskeg areas and mature and old growth coniferous forests that contain terrestrial 
and arboreal (tree-inhabiting) lichens (Environment Canada 2014c). Terrestrial lichens are the most 
important food source for caribou throughout the year and are found primarily in old forests (ASRD and 
Alberta Conservation Association 2010). Boreal caribou are typically found in peatland complexes 
dominated by black spruce and larch (Anderson 1999, Bradshaw et al. 1995, Hornbeck and Moyles 1995). 
In northern Alberta, research has shown that even in areas where small peatlands are interspersed in an 
upland matrix, caribou tend to select treed bogs and fens (Anderson 1999).  

The critical habitat for the boreal population of woodland caribou is discussed in Section 7.2.9.2. 

Barn Swallow (Threatened by COSEWIC): Barn swallows forage in open areas and nest in under-hangs of 
man-made structures, such as buildings, sheds, bridges and culverts (COSEWIC 2011). While the number 
of barns and amount of foraging habitat in agricultural areas has declined in some areas of Canada, the 
causes of the recent population decline of up to 76% in the last 40 years are not well understood. Changes 
in habitat, insect communities and climate have been implicated in the decline of barn swallow populations 
(COSEWIC 2011).  

Canada Warbler (Threatened on Schedule 1 of the SARA and by COSEWIC): Canada warblers use a wide 
range of deciduous, coniferous and mixed forests with a well-developed shrub layer and a structurally 
complex forest floor (COSEWIC 2008a). Breeding habitat in Alberta has been described as thick stands of 
willow and alder along streams, dense shrubs in or near water, substantial deciduous undergrowth taller 
than 1.5 m and a ground slope equal or greater than 15 degrees (Semenchuk 1992).  

Common Nighthawk (Threatened on Schedule 1 of the SARA and by COSEWIC): Common nighthawks 
breed in or near open or semi-open habitat such as recently logged areas, recently burned-over areas, 
forest clearings, short-grass prairies, pastures, open forests, peatbogs, marshes, lakeshores, gravel roads, 
riverbanks, rocky outcrops and rock barrens (COSEWIC 2007a). This species nests on sand, rock, gravel, 
leaf litter or forest duff which may be on flat areas or slopes and may be sheltered by nearby boulders or 
shrubs. Common nighthawks frequent aerial habitats, often feeding high in the air, scooping up insects in 
flight (Semenchuk 1992).

Horned Grebe (Special Concern by COSEWIC): Horned grebes forage by diving in shallow waters often 
near emergent vegetation and will also forage on surface prey and snatch insects from the air or 
overhanging plants (Johnsgard 1987). Their diet mainly consists of small fishes, crustaceans and aquatic 
insects, and also includes amphibians and leeches (Semenchuk 1992). Horned grebes nest in both open 
and forested areas, preferring those ponds, sloughs and lakes with extensive, marshy vegetation. The 
emerging vegetation provides nest materials, concealment, anchorage and protection for young 
(COSEWIC 2009). Nests are a floating mass of decayed and fresh aquatic vegetation built up in shallow 
waters and anchored to reeds (Semenchuk 1992).  

Olive-sided Flycatcher (Threatened on Schedule 1 of the SARA and by COSEWIC): Olive-sided flycatchers 
are most often associated with openings in coniferous or mixed coniferous forest, including forest edges 
near natural openings (such as rivers, muskeg, bogs or swamps) that contain tall, live trees or snags for 
perching, foraging and nesting. They are also associated with man-made openings (such as logged areas), 
burned forest or open to semi-open mature forest (COSEWIC 2007b).  

Rusty Blackbird (Special Concern on Schedule 1 of the SARA and by COSEWIC): Rusty blackbirds nest in 
boreal forest wetlands near or over open water and preferentially select openings in wet coniferous and 
mixedwood forests, particularly swampy shores beside lakes, rivers and streams for both nesting and 
foraging (Semenchuk 1992, Smithsonian National Zoological Park 2007). Nesting habitat can include forest 
wetlands, such as slow-moving streams, peat bogs, sedge meadows, marshes, swamps, beaver ponds 
and pasture edges (COSEWIC 2006, Semenchuk 1992). Rusty blackbirds have an affinity for conifers, 
especially spruce, for nest sites since it has been shown that nest survival increases with black spruce 
density (Matsuoka et al. 2010). Rusty blackbirds rely heavily on adults and aquatic larvae of wetland insects 
as their primary food source (Smithsonian National Zoological Park 2007).  

Short-eared Owl (Special Concern by COSEWIC): Short-eared owls are often associated with open habitat, 
including grasslands, bogs, marshes, old pastures and occasionally agricultural fields (COSEWIC 2008b, 
Environment Canada 2014c). The short-eared owl breeds in open country with short vegetation, including 
rangelands, grasslands, near dry marshes, farmlands, brushy fields and forest clearings (Semenchuk 
1992). A combination of areas of suitable resting and nesting cover with adjacent hunting areas is a 
dominant factor in selecting breeding habitat (Johnsgard 1988). 

Yellow Rail (Special Concern on Schedule 1 of the SARA and by COSEWIC): Yellow rails are found in 
wetlands (e.g., fens) dominated by sedges, grasses and rushes where there is little or no standing water 
(generally 0-12 cm water depth) and where the substrate remains saturated throughout the summer 
(COSEWIC 2001, Federation of Alberta Naturalists 2007, Semenchuk 1992). It has been suggested that 
only wetlands large enough to support a small group of territorial birds will have yellow rails on a long-term 
basis (Semenchuk 1992). Nests are constructed of grasses and other dead emergent vegetation, and are 
situated on the ground and well concealed by a canopy of bent over grass in or near a marsh 
(Semenchuk 1992).  

Western Toad (Special Concern on Schedule 1 of the SARA and by COSEWIC): Western toads are found 
at all elevations within its range, though are primarily found in the boreal forest, subalpine and alpine 
habitats of Alberta (Russell and Bauer 1993). Western toads breed in ponds, stream edges or the shallow 
margins of lakes as well as in ditches and road ruts (COSEWIC 2002). During the breeding season, western 
toads congregate in these bodies of water, preferring shallow water with a sandy bottom (i.e., pools or small 
ponds) (Russell and Bauer 1993), and will breed in both permanent and temporary bodies of water. Browne 
(2010) found that the western toad uses a variety of habitat types, selecting habitats that facilitate growth 
(warm, open habitat with abundant prey) and/or habitats that provide essential resources (e.g., moisture, 
shelter, breeding locations). Wet shrub was the most highly selected land cover type, likely having warm 
temperatures during the day in the summer, and high levels of soil moisture and sources of water that are 
important for amphibians to avoid desiccation (Browne 2010).  

Table 5.11.2 provides information related to potential habitat and a summary of field results for wildlife 
species listed under Schedule 1 of SARA or by COSEWIC that have the potential to occur in the vicinity of 
the Project.

5.12 Human Occupancy and Resource Use  

This subsection presents a summary of general patterns and potential interactions between human 
occupancy and resource use and the Project in the HORU LSA and HORU RSA (Figures 5.8).  

The potential effects related to the proposed Project and key mitigation pertaining to Human Occupancy 
and Resource Use are discussed in Section 6.2.12.  

The spatial boundary of the HORU LSA is defined by a 2 km wide band centred on the pipeline right-of-way 
centre line (i.e., 1 km on both sides of the centre line) and around the perimeter of the compressor station. 
The spatial boundary for the HORU RSA includes the RSA boundaries of water quality and quantity, fish 
and fish habitat, wetlands, vegetation, wildlife and wildlife habitat and heritage resources. The HORU LSA 
and HORU RSA are described in greater detail in Section 6.2.12, including the rationale for the 
determination of these boundaries.

Liege Lateral Loop 2 – Thornbury Section Pipeline and 
the Leismer East Compressor Station Project 

September 2014 / 496955/492475 

 
5.12.1 Land Use 

The proposed Project is approximately 36 km in length and located in the Green Area of northeast Alberta. 
The Project is located entirely on Crown-owned lands in a forested setting within the Green Area of Alberta. 
Lands crossed by the Project Footprint consist primarily of a native vegetation with intermittent areas of 
anthropogenic usage (e.g., pipelines, roads, etc.). 

The Project crosses the RM of Wood Buffalo and Lac La Biche County. Land use planning conflicts are not 
anticipated as the Project parallels existing rights-of-way infrastructure for approximately 28 km or 77% of 
its length.  

5.12.2 Land Use and Development Plans 

Descriptions of the key regional land use and development plans for the area crossed by the Project are 
described below. Conflicts between the land use objectives of the plans and the Project were not identified. 

5.12.2.1 Lower Athabasca Regional Plan 

The LARP was developed as a long-term strategy that reflects provincial policies at the regional level while 
also ensuring economic, environmental and social objectives are met (Government of Alberta 2012a). The 
direction of the LARP embodies that of Alberta’s Land-use Framework in which the provincial government 
has committed to the collaborative management of cumulative effects to understand the pressures of 
multiple developments (Government of Alberta 2012a). Through the LARP, long-term objectives and the 
strategies to achieve them have been established. Monitoring systems have also been put in place to 
evaluate the level of achievement in meeting the objectives (Government of Alberta 2012a). 

5.12.2.2 Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo Municipal Development Plan 

The RM of Wood Buffalo MDP provides direction to urban areas, rural communities and undeveloped land 
in the region while managing high levels of anticipated growth (RM of Wood Buffalo 2011). The MDP acts 
as a guide for both short and long-term strategies in the RM of Wood Buffalo without specifically identifying 
infrastructure expenditures, industrial developments or zoning requirements (RM of Wood Buffalo 2011).  

5.12.2.3 Lac La Biche County Municipal Development Plan 

The Lac La Biche County MDP is intended to guide economic growth in the region by establishing clear 
goals, objectives and policies in regards to land use planning. The MDP attempts to minimize land use 
conflicts while promoting sustainable development. Furthermore, the MDP ensures support for the 
administration and implementation of the Land Use Bylaw (ISL Engineering and Land Services 2013).  

5.12.3 Human Habitation 

An ocular assessment was performed to locate residences in the HORU LSA. Spatial data to run GIS 
analyses for locations of residences were not available. 

Based on the ocular assessment, no residences were identified within the HORU LSA. Fort McMurray, 
Alberta is located within the HORU RSA approximately 83.6 km north of KP 0.3.   

5.12.4 Outdoor Recreational Use 

No formal outdoor recreational use areas were identified in the Project Footprint (Mussio Ventures 
Ltd. 2012). One campground is located in the HORU RSA near Mariana Lake (Mussio Ventures Ltd. 2012). 
The Mariana Lake Forest Recreation Area is located approximately 2.2 km south west of KP 2.0 
(AltaLIS 2008). 

The land in the Project Footprint or in the HORU LSA could potentially be used for outdoor activities such 
as walking, hiking, cross-country skiing, or for use by motorized vehicles such as ATVs and snowmobiles 
(Mussio Ventures Ltd. 2012). Recreational use in the HORU RSA includes camping, wildlife viewing, 
paddling (canoeing and kayaking) and boating (Mussio Ventures Ltd. 2012).

5.12.5 Parks and Protected Areas 

This subsection identifies local, regional, provincial and national parks, as well as Environmentally 
Significant Areas and protected areas found along the proposed Project and in the HORU LSA and RSA. 
In Alberta, county, district and provincial parks, ecological reserves and game bird sanctuaries help protect 
lands for wildlife and recreational purposes.  

No parks and protected areas, ecological reserves or conservation areas are located in the Footprint or 
HORU LSA of the Project. 

Grand Rapids Wildland Provincial Park is located 16.7 km north east of KP 36.3 in the HORU RSA. 
Recreation activities in the park include backcountry camping, fishing, hiking, hunting and wildlife viewing. 
The parks’ Grand Rapids Wilderness Adventures offer boat rentals, cabin and lodge rentals as well as 
guided fishing and hunting. The facilities are accessible by river, float plane and snowmobile only (Alberta 
Parks 2014).  

ATPR defines Environmentally Significant Areas as being important to the long-term maintenance of 
biological diversity, soil, water or other natural processes, at multiple spatial scales and/or areas that contain 
rare or unique elements or that include elements that may require special management consideration due 
to their conservation needs (Fiera 2009). ATPR also states that Environmentally Significant Areas do not 
represent government policy and do not necessarily require legal protection since they are intended to be 
an informational tool to help inform land use planning and policy at local, regional and provincial scales 
(Fiera 2009). Environmentally Significant Areas are discussed further in the aquatic, wetland, vegetation 
and wildlife sections (Section 5.3, 5.8, 5.9 and 5.10, respectively). 

5.12.6 Aesthetic Attributes 

As noted, the pipeline route parallels existing rights-of-way and other existing linear infrastructure 
(i.e., pipelines, roads and seismic lines) for approximately 28 km or 77% of its length. The pipeline route 
crosses Highway 63, from which the disturbance caused by construction may be visible.  

5.12.7 Managed Forest Areas 

The Project is located in Forest Management Unit (FMU) A-14, which is operated by Alberta-Pacific Forest 
Products Incorporated (AlPac) under Forest Management Agreement (FMA) 9100029 (AESRD 2013d, 
Alberta Energy 2014a). As of June 2013, FMU A-14 included an Annual Allowable Cut (AAC) of 
approximately 218,586 m3 and FMU L-3 included an AAC approximately 171,912 m3 (AESRD 2013e). 
Table 5.12.1 lists the FMUs crossed by the Project.  

There is one existing coniferous timber license (CTL L030047)_in the Project area assigned to Miller 
Western Forest Products Ltd (Alberta Energy 2014a).

No excavation pits from which gravel, sand or clay are removed were identified as being crossed by the 
proposed route or in the HORU LSA.  

Existing protective and consultative notations related to Crown dispositions include PNT 120088, 
PNT 130062, CNT 950097 and CNC 970002 (Alberta Energy 2014a). The PNT holders are the Lac La 
Biche Lands Department and the Alberta Ministry of Transportation. Both PNTs are intended to avoid  non-
compatible land use at 81-15 W4M. CNT 950097 is held by the AESRD Operations Division for surface 
material exploration. Finally, CNC 970002 is held by Suncor Energy Inc. and is intended to restrict 
development at the existing surface mineral lease. No conflicts are anticipated, nonetheless, NGTL will 
consult with the disposition holders to ensure there are no conflicts prior to construction. 

The Project is located in an area where oil and gas infrastructure is common. For this reason, it is the 
intention to minimize further disruption to land and resource use in the area by paralleling existing linear 
rights-of-way for approximately 77% of the length of the proposed pipeline route. 

The pipeline component of the Project crosses existing oil and gas pipelines on 19 occasions. There are 
approximately 13 oil and gas facilities, 19 pipelines and 7 wells in the HORU LSA. Operators of this 
infrastructure include Stonewater Resources Inc., Paramount Resources Ltd., Husky Oil Operations 
Limited, Altagas Ltd., ATCO Electric Ltd., Shaw Cable Systems Ltd., Suncor Energy Inc., Alberta Oil Sands 
Pipeline Ltd., Inter Pipeline (Corridor) Inc. and Williams Energy Canada ULC (Alberta Energy 2014a).

5.12.9 Non-Traditional Hunting, Trapping and Fishing 

5.12.9.1 Hunting 

In general, hunting seasons, species available for hunting and rules and regulations vary by area within 
Alberta. Although these areas encompass larger areas than the proposed Project study areas, they provide 
an indication of hunting activity in the HORU LSA and RSA. 

AESRD manages wildlife according to Alberta’s Wildlife Act by dividing land into designated WMU. Hunting 
seasons, species available for hunting, and rules and regulations vary by WMU (AESRD 2014g). The 
Project is located in the WMU 512 from KP 0.0 to KP 21.6 and in WMU 519 from KP 21.6 to KP 36.3. WMUs 
512 and 519 include hunting seasons for a variety of game species and hunting methods that are open for 
periods of time between August 25 and November 30 (Government of Alberta 2013b). 

In WMUs 512 and 519, the general hunting season for white-tailed deer, mule deer and moose is 
September 1 to November 30 and August 25 to August 31 for archery only (Government of Alberta 2013b). 
The hunting season for snow geese, Canada geese, ducks, coots and snipe is September 1 to December 
16. For male pheasant, ruffed grouse, spruce grouse and gray partridge, the hunting season extends from 
September 1 to November 30. In WMU 519, the hunting season for sharp-tailed grouse is from October 1 
to 31 (Government of Alberta 2013b). 

5.12.9.2 Guide Outfitting 

Non-resident hunters in Alberta require the guidance of licensed outfitters or hunter hosts for big game 
species (Government of Alberta 2013c). Guide outfitters and hunter hosts are not required for game bird 
hunting in the province (Government of Alberta 2013c). The main hunting seasons for Alberta big game 
species and game birds are fall and spring, with most hunting activities occurring from early September to 
late-November. 

In 2013, there were 22 guide outfitters operating in the WMUs crossed by the Project (Brick pers. comm.).   

5.12.9.3 Trapping 

Trapping seasons are generally open from early-October to mid-May in Alberta. Construction of the Project 
may overlap with regulated trapping seasons depending upon the location and timing of construction 
activities.  

For the purposes of trapping, Alberta is divided into eight Fur Management Zones (Government of 
Alberta 2014a). A Registered Fur Management Area (RFMA) is “...a parcel of public land the boundary of 
which is described on the original Registered Fur Management Licence” (Government of Alberta 2014a). 
There are approximately 1,700 RFMAs in the province (Government of Alberta 2014a). Senior Licence 
Holders have permission to trap on a specific RFMA for a period of five years and trapping licences must 
be renewed annually (Government of Alberta 2014a). 

The Project is located in Fur Management Zone 1. Common fur-bearing species that are trapped in Alberta 
are badger, beaver, coyote, fox, mink, muskrat, squirrel, weasel and wolf (Government of Alberta 2014a).  

The pipeline route crosses three registered trapping areas (TPAs): TPA 2278 from KP 0.0 to KP 5.5; 
TPA 2867 from KP 5.5 to KP 24.3; and TPA 1217 from KP 24.3 to KP 36.3 (Alberta Energy 2014a).

5.12.9.4 Fishing  

Alberta is divided into three Fish Management Zones and the proposed Project is located in Zone 3, the 
Northern Boreal (NB) Zone, in Watershed Unit NB4 (Government of Alberta 2014b). Many of the streams 
in the boreal forest are low gradient, brown water streams due to the drainage of muskegs. Most of the 
lakes in Alberta are present in the NB Zone (Government of Alberta 2014b). Common sport fishing species 
found in the NB Zone are yellow perch, northern pike, walleye, lake whitefish, Arctic grayling and lake trout 
(Government of Alberta 2014b). Fishing seasons, limits and other regulations are specific to lakes and 
streams with most having at least one seasonal closure (Government of Alberta 2014b). 

5.12.10 Water Supply and Use 

Water well records within 500 m of the centre line of the pipeline construction right-of-way were reviewed. 
A total of three wells were identified, including:  

• one well for domestic use; and 

• two wells for industrial use (AESRD 2014d). 

Water supply and use is discussed in the context of numerous environmental and socio-economic elements 
of this ESA. Navigable waters are discussed in Section 5.18; municipal water is discussed in Section 5.17; 
non-traditional fishing areas are discussed in Section 5.12; water quality and quantity, including 
groundwater and surface water, is discussed in Section 5.3; fish and fish habitat is discussed in Section 5.7; 
and wetlands are discussed in Section 5.8.  

5.13 Heritage Resources  

This section presents a summary of potential heritage resources encountered along the pipeline route and 
in the Heritage Resources RSA (Figure 5.9). The Heritage Resources RSA consists of the area extending 
beyond the Footprint and is defined as an area of adjoining Borden Blocks intersected by the pipeline 
(Borden and Duff 1952). A Borden Block measures 10 minutes of latitude by 10 minutes of longitude. For 
the Project, the Borden Blocks intersected by the Project measure approximately 12 km east-west by 18 km 
north-south. Known archaeological, historical and palaeontological sites are confidential and as a result, 
their precise locations will not be identified. Rather, sites have been identified on maps included in the HRIA 
final report for Permit A13-171 provided to Alberta Culture. The Alberta Culture Historical Resources Act 
Approval and Requirements for the Project are provided in Appendix 9.  

The potential effects on heritage resources related to the construction of the Project and mitigation 
pertaining to heritage resources are discussed in Section 6.2.13.

5.13.1 Potential Archaeological Areas 

Archaeological and historic sites are both areas that preserve some component of past human activity. 
Archaeological sites, unlike historical sites, are composed of artifacts associated with a prehistoric period 
that precedes the written record. Historic sites are areas of human activity that were created after the 
appearance of writing and prior to the last 50 years. Modern sites are generally sites created later than 
50 years before present.  

Locations within the Footprint that are considered to have low archaeological potential are characterized 
by flat, featureless terrain, water saturated environments such as bogs and muskeg, moderately to steeply 
sloping terrain and previously disturbed lands (e.g., roadways and industrial developments). Areas such as 
these are not targeted for pedestrian assessments, however, these areas were assessed by desktop review 
as well as aerial photography. 

Areas within the Footprint that are considered to have moderate to high archaeological potential and, 
targeted as a result, are characterized by at least one of the following features: 

• areas of level, well-drained terrain adjacent to defined water sources (e.g., rivers, lakes); 

• the level tops and benches of well-defined, elevated landforms, such as knolls and 
eskers, in areas of otherwise level terrain; 

• level terrain adjacent to distinct breaks-in-slope; 

• micro-topographic relief, providing well-drained landforms adjacent to or within low-lying 
areas or muskeg; and 

• the locations of previously known archaeological or historic period sites. 

The pipeline construction right-of-way crosses two Natural Subregions within Alberta: the Lower Boreal 
Highlands and the Central Mixedwood Natural Subregion (Natural Regions Committee 2006). The Project 
area is dominated by flat, low-lying, and poorly drained muskeg terrain, populated by black spruce, moss, 
and Labrador tea. This low-lying muskeg is broken by areas of slightly elevated, well-drained, and rolling 
terrain, with a spruce, poplar and pine mixed forest, moss and grass ground cover, and an understory 
comprised of willow, rose bush, cranberries, and horse tail (refer to Section 5.9). 

Historical Resource Values (HRVs) (numbered 0 to 5) are assigned by Alberta Culture based on the 
presence of previously known heritage resources or the topographic potential in that particular parcel of 
land to contain heritage resources (this is the same system for paleontological resources). Most of the lands 
crossed by the pipeline route and located in proximity to the proposed Leismer East Compressor Station 
site have no HRV, however, several quarter-sections have been assigned HRVs for palaeontological 
resources (see Section 5.13.2), and these have been assessed in the past under Alberta Culture Permit 
A13-071 for the pipeline development which directly parallels the pipeline route. There is a single, previously 
recorded site within the Heritage Resources RSA (GlPc-1) and no previously recorded sites within the 
Project Footprint. GlPc-1 is a small artifact scatter (n<10) located on a terraced landform adjacent to an 
incised watercourse, well outside of the Project Footprint. 

There were three areas of archaeological potential were identified during pre-field assessment work of the 
proposed pipeline route based upon the identification of microtopographical features of archaeological 
potential associated with drainages. 

5.13.2 Traditional Ecological Knowledge 

TEK gathered during field studies was integrated into the HRIA for the Project and the opinions of 
participants directly influenced assessments of archaeological potential during the field survey. Results of 
TEK collected, including issues and concerns and proposed mitigation measures and/or responses to those 
issues are compiled in the TK Report (Appendix 10).

5.13.3 Potential Palaeontological Areas 

The study of palaeontology seeks information about several aspects of past organisms; for example, their 
identity, origin, environment and evolution. There are two types of palaeontological resources: body fossils; 
and trace fossils. Body fossils are the remnants of an organism, such as a skeleton or leaf imprint, that is 
embedded and preserved within the earth’s crust. Trace fossils consist of tracks, burrows, coprolites and 
marks left by feeding, which reflect the organisms’ behaviours.  

A Schedule B was issued by Alberta Culture for the Project requiring a palaeontological assessment 
(Appendix C of Appendix 9). The Project site was assessed in October 2013 and it was found that 
palaeontological potential throughout this area is low and no further action is recommended. No Quaternary 
fossils, either macro or micro were observed. Areas of potential concern include the incised House River 
valley, where Cretaceous LaBiche Formation deposits may be exposed during construction, especially if 
trenching is used. The LaBiche Formation represents a succession of marine siltstone and shale with 
occasional marine sandstones. The LaBiche Formation occurs in northern Alberta and contains a rich fauna 
including invertebrates such as molluscs (ammonites and bivalves) and vertebrates (bony fish). The only 
area with significant incision and exposure of the underlying surficial and bedrock geology is in the House 
River valley. The Quaternary sediment encountered surrounding the valley is thin, no terraces were found, 
and has little paleontological potential. 

5.14 Traditional Land and Resource Use  

The study of TLU seeks information about the current and historic geographic locations, types of resources 
used and traditional/cultural activities that Aboriginal communities have historically and continue to occupy 
and use for cultural purposes. The TLRU LSA encompasses and extends beyond the Footprint to include 
the LSA boundaries of water quality and quantity, fish and fish habitat, wetlands, vegetation, wildlife and 
wildlife habitat and heritage resources since TLU is dependent on these resources. Accordingly, the LSA 
is defined as a 2 km wide band centred on the construction right-of-way centre line (i.e., 1 km on both sides 
of the centre line) and a 1 km buffer around the compressor station. The LSA is the area where there is a 
reasonable potential for localized Project-related effects to existing traditional land uses (e.g., trapping, 
hunting, fishing and gathering areas). The TLRU RSA is defined as a 30 km wide band centred on the 
proposed pipeline route centre line (i.e., 15 km on both sides of the centre line), with a 15 km buffer around 
the compressor station (Figure 5.10).

NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd.  Environmental and Socio-Economic Assessment 
Liege Lateral Loop 2 – Thornbury Section Pipeline and 
the Leismer East Compressor Station Project 

September 2014 / 496955/492475 

 
The Project crosses the MD of Wood Buffalo and Lac La Biche County, and is within the jurisdiction of the 
LARP (Government of Alberta 2012a). The goal of outcome 7 of the LARP is "inclusion of Aboriginal 
peoples in land-use planning". Among the strategies to achieve this outcome, the LARP states that "the 
Government of Alberta will continue to consult with Aboriginal peoples in a meaningful way when 
government decisions may adversely affect the continued exercise of their constitutionally protected rights, 
and the input from such consultations continues to be considered prior to the decision" (Government of 
Alberta 2012a). In addition, the Wood Buffalo MDP has the following directions related to TLU. Direction 
5.1.2 states that the RM of Wood Buffalo "will support the efforts of heritage, First Nations, and Métis groups 
in their efforts to develop inventories and other tools to help conserve traditional lands, historic sites, 
heritage buildings, and cultural artifacts" and Direction 5.1.3 states that the RM will respect traditional and 
historic uses, and will support efforts to identify and conserve such areas (RM of Wood Buffalo 2011).  

While the Lac La Biche County MDP does not contain any objectives specifically related to TLU, some plan 
objectives related to resource extraction may be relevant to consideration of impacts of the Project on TLU. 
Objective 7.5.1 of the plan states that Lac La Biche will advocate to protect County historic, environmental, 
natural archaeological, scientific, and cultural resources from the potential impacts of proposed resource 
extraction developments. Additionally, Objective 7.5.3 states that the plan will not allow resource extraction 
development proposals “…in areas which are known to possess unique historical and/or environmental 
features that would be disturbed or destroyed by resource extraction or in areas that are deemed to be 
environmentally sensitive” (Lac La Biche County 2014). Through the implementation of planning 
consideration and mitigation measures, it is believed that the Project meets the primary objective of the Lac 
La Biche County MDP. 

Aboriginal communities in the Project RSA have historically used or presently use Crown lands in the region 
to maintain a traditional lifestyle. House River Indian Cemetery (I.R. 178), 16.6 km north of KP 36.3 (HDD 
option) or KP 36.4 (proposed contingency crossing location) is the closest reserve to the TLRU RSA. 
Although the Project does not cross any IRs, it does cross the asserted traditional territories and areas of 
interest of a number of Aboriginal communities, as it is within the boundaries of Treaty 8, and Métis Nation 
of Alberta Zone 1 (Appendix 10). 

To identify a preliminary list of Aboriginal groups, NGTL conducted desktop research to assess the proximity 
of the Project to: 

• reserves under the Indian Act; 

• Métis communities; 

• asserted traditional territories; and 

• known areas of traditional use. 

An initial list of Aboriginal communities potentially affected by the Project was developed through a 
combination of desktop research, NGTL’s own operating experience and NGTL’s established network of 
contacts with Aboriginal groups. Using this engagement process, NGTL identified and has subsequently 
notified or engaged the communities listed in Section 3.4. More information regarding NGTL’s Aboriginal 
Engagement Program is found in the Project Application (Attachment AM1). 

NGTL provided the Alberta Aboriginal Consultation Office with an overview of the engagement activities 
and requested a First Nations pre-consultation assessment for the Project. The Aboriginal Consultation 
Office expressed no issues or concerns with the summary provided by NGTL, and confirmed by way of the 
First Nations pre-consultation (No. 201404450) that notification with follow up was required with Beaver 
Lake Cree Nation, Fort McMurray First Nation No. 468 and Heart Lake First Nation. NGTL expects to submit 
the First Nations pre-consultation Adequacy Assessment to the Aboriginal Consultation Office with respect 
to engagement conducted for the Project’s Public Lands Act applications in fall 2014. 

Following Project initiation, interested communities were invited to participate in a TLU study for the Project 
(Appendix 10). NGTL provides funding to assist Aboriginal communities with community directed TLU 
studies. The Christina River Dene Nation Council conducted a desktop review of TLU sites. Saddle Lake

Cree Nation has conducted a TERA-led Project TLU overflight. The following communities have engaged 
a third party to conduct a combined TLU study on their behalf:  

• Fort McMurray Métis Local No. 1935; 

• Willow Lake Métis Local No. 780  

• Conklin Métis No. 193; and 

• Lakeland Métis Local No. 1909. 

The Owl River Métis Local No. 1949 have agreed to conduct a community-led Project TLU study. The 
Chipewayn Prairie Dene First Nation will provide a regional TLU planning study in lieu of a Project-specific 
study. NGTL is currently negotiating the terms of a third-party TLU study with Fort McMurray First Nation 
No. 468. Heart Lake First Nation have expressed interest in completing an independent TLU study, but a 
funding request and scope of work have not been received to date by NGTL. 

Bigstone Cree Nation met with NGTL in June 2013 to discuss engagement for the Project. Bigstone Cree 
Nation informed NGTL that they did not have an interest in participating in Project engagement activities as 
the project is outside of their traditional territory. Fort McMurray Métis Local No. 2020 has not responded 
to invitations from NGTL to discuss engagement for the Project. NGTL remains open to discussing 
Project-specific issues with Heart Lake First Nation, Chipewyan Prairie Dene First Nation, Fort McMurray 
Métis Local No. 2020, Métis Nation of Alberta and Métis Nation of Alberta Zone 1 and will continue to 
provide regular updates. Beaver Lake Cree Nation has confirmed that it does not have any outstanding 
concerns about the Project. NGTL will continue to inform Beaver Lake Cree Nation about the Project. A TK 
Report was prepared by TERA which incorporates the results of engagement and TLU studies conducted 
with participating Aboriginal communities (Appendix 10). Additional information regarding descriptions and 
locations of known TLU sites within the TLU RSA is provided in the TK Report (Appendix 10).  

5.15 Social and Cultural Well-Being 

This subsection summarizes general patterns and potential interactions between social and cultural 
well-being and the Project in the Socio-economic LSA and Socio-economic RSA (Figures 5.11). The spatial 
boundary of the Socio-economic LSA is defined as the boundaries of communities, where it can reasonably 
be expected that direct effects from the proposed Project would occur. These communities include the 
Urban Service Area of Fort McMurray and the Town of Athabasca. The spatial boundary for the Socio-
economic RSA consists of the boundaries of the RM of Wood Buffalo and Lac La Biche County.  

The Project may result in potential interactions with the Unincorporated Community of Mariana Lake and 
the Hamlet of Conklin, Hamlet of Janvier, Hamlet of Anzac, Hamlet of Lac La Biche and other nearby 
communities. Statistical data for unincorporated hamlets and communities are amalgamated into the county 
or region in which they are geographically located and by which they are administered. As such, 
unincorporated hamlets and communities are not identified as study area communities. Information on key 
unincorporated hamlets and communities that may be directly affected by the Project is presented where 
available. 

The potential effects related to the proposed Project and key mitigation pertaining to social and cultural 
well-being are discussed in Section 6.2.15.The Socio-economic LSA and RSA are described in greater 
detail in Section 6.2.15, including the rationale for the determination of these boundaries.

Demographic data from Statistics Canada for non-Aboriginal and Aboriginal communities in the 
Socio-economic LSA and RSA is outlined in Table 5.15.2.  

Demographic data from Statistics Canada for Aboriginal communities in the Socio-economic LSA and RSA 
is outlined in Table 5.15.2. Statistics Canada randomly rounds some data to 0 or 5. When such rounded 
and imprecise data are converted to percentages, the totals of these percentages sometimes do not sum 
to 100%. This is most obvious in relation to the sex ratio of the total population, which often does not sum 
to 100%. 

Population characteristics for the RM of Wood Buffalo include information for the Hamlet of Anzac, the 
Hamlet of Conklin and the Hamlet of Janvier as well as Unincorporated Community of Mariana Lake. 
According to the 2010 RM of Wood Buffalo census, the population of the Hamlet of Anzac was 785, the 
population of the Hamlet of Conklin was 337 and the population of the Hamlet of Janvier was 195 (RM of 
Wood Buffalo 2014).  

Population characteristics for the County of Lac La Biche include information for the Hamlet of Lac La Biche 
and the Hamlet of Plamondon. In 2011, the population of the Hamlet of Lac La Biche was 2,544 and the 
population of the Hamlet of Plamondon was 354 (Statistics Canada 2012).

5.16 Human Health 

This subsection summarizes general patterns and potential interactions between human health and the 
proposed Project in the HORU LSA and HORU RSA (Figure 5.10). The potential effects related to the 
proposed Project and key mitigation pertaining to human health are discussed in Section 6.2.16. 

Human health is defined as “...a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and the ability to 
adapt to the stresses of daily life; it is not merely the absence of disease or infirmity” (NEB 2014b, World 
Health Organization 1946). This interpretation of human health recognizes the interrelationships between 
the social, biophysical, economic and cultural environments. These interrelationships change depending 
upon the nature of the project and its location. 

The spatial boundary of the HORU LSA is defined by a 2 km wide band centred on the construction right-of-
way (i.e., 1 km on both sides of the construction right-of-way centre line). The spatial boundary for the 
HORU RSA includes the RSA boundaries of water quality and quantity, fish and fish habitat, wetlands, 
vegetation, wildlife and wildlife habitat and heritage resources. The HORU LSA and RSA are described in 
greater detail in Section 6.2.12, including the rationale for the determination of these boundaries. 

The environmental elements associated with the proposed Project that may be related to human health 
include physical and meteorological environment, soil and soil productivity, water quality and quantity, air 
and GHG emissions, acoustic environment, fish and fish habitat, wildlife and wildlife habitat, and accidents 
and malfunctions. Socio-economic elements that may be related to human health include HORU, TLU, 
social and cultural well-being, infrastructure and services, and navigation and navigation safety.

5.17 Infrastructure and Services 

This subsection summarizes general patterns and potential interactions between infrastructure and 
services and the proposed Project in the Socio-economic LSA and Socio-economic RSA (Figure 5.11). The 
potential Project-related effects and key mitigation pertaining to infrastructure and services are discussed 
in Section 6.2.17. 

The spatial boundary of the Socio-economic LSA is defined as the boundaries of communities where it can 
reasonably be expected that direct effects from the proposed Project would occur. These communities 
include the Urban Service Area of Fort McMurray and the Town of Athabasca. The spatial boundary for the 
Socio-economic RSA consists of the boundaries of the RM of Wood Buffalo and Lac La Biche County. The 
Socio-economic LSA and Socio-economic RSA are described in greater detail in Section 6.2.15, including 
the rationale for the determination of these boundaries.  

5.17.1 Transportation Infrastructure 

Roads and Traffic 
Frequency, timing and duration of traffic interruptions that could arise during construction of the proposed 
Project are difficult to determine at this time. Highway 63 and two existing all-weather roads will be used to 
access the right-of-way and winter roads will be used where all weather roads have not been developed. 
There will be one new permanent access road (259 m long) required to support the Project. No road 
closures are anticipated, however, traffic may be temporarily delayed while equipment is moved across 
roadways.  

In 2013, an automated traffic recorder (ATR) located on Highway 63 at Mariana Lake recorded an average 
annual daily traffic (AADT) of 4,491 vehicles, which was an increase of 1,121 vehicles from 2009 (Alberta 
Transportation 2013, 2014a). The highest monthly traffic volumes in 2013 were from May to October 
(Alberta Transportation 2014a). 

It is anticipated that pipe and equipment will be transported using Highway 63. Access to the proposed 
Project will also occur via Highway 63 and existing industrial and access roads. Highway 63, which is 
crossed by the proposed Project at KP 2.7, serves as the major transportation route to oil sands 
development near Fort McMurray and Fort Mackay. The Government of Alberta has committed to upgrading 
Highway 63 to improve safety for motorists. Upgrades include the twinning of the highway between 
Grassland and Fort McMurray by fall 2016 (Alberta Transportation 2014b).  

Railways 
No rail lines are crossed by the Project.  

Airports 
Air transportation may be used to transport workers and goods for Project-related activities. The nearest 
regional/passenger airport is the Fort McMurray Airport located approximately 87.4 km north from KP 0.3 
(Aviation Strategy Action Group 2003). The closest community airports are located approximately 76.5 km 
north east from KP 0.0 near the Hamlet of Janvier. 

5.17.2 Transmission Lines and Power Supply 

In the RM of Wood Buffalo and Lac La Biche County, the regulated providers of power include Direct Energy 
Regulated Services and Epor Energy Inc. FortisAlberta. AltasGas Utilities and Epcor Energy Inc. 
FortisAlberta are the regulated providers of power for the Town of Athabasca (Government of 
Alberta 2013d). 

5.17.3 Emergency, Protective, Health Care and Social Services 

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Eastern Alberta District provides police and protective 
services to the areas surrounding the Project. Police services include patrolling, enforcing bylaws and 
emergency response. The closest RCMP detachment to the Project is located in the Fort McMurray 
(RCMP 2014). The Fort McMurray (Wood Buffalo) RCMP detachment also services the Hamlets of Anzac,

Conklin and Janvier (RCMP 2013). The Hamlet of Wandering River is serviced by the Boyle RCMP 
detachment. The Town of Athabasca also has an RCMP detachment (RCMP 2014).  

The RM of Wood Buffalo Regional Emergency Services (RES) provides fire suppression, rescue, 
emergency medical services, dangerous goods response and fire prevention. The RES consists of a 
department in Fort McMurray that includes four fire falls and one communication dispatch centre, as well 
as rural volunteer fire departments in Fort MacKay, Saprae Creek Estates, Gregoire Lake Estates, the 
Hamlet of Anzac, the Hamlet of Janvier and Conklin (RM of Wood Buffalo 2014).  

The Lac La Biche County Protective Services department operates a volunteer fire department in the 
Hamlet of Lac La Biche. The fire permitting area comprises a small area in the southern portion of the 
county (Lac La Biche County 2014). 

The Athabasca Volunteer Fire Department provides fire protection to the Town of Athabasca and the nearby 
surrounding area (Athabasca County 2011).  

Wildfire response in the Project area in both the RM of Wood Buffalo and Lac La Biche County is provided 
by the Forestry Division of AESRD (AESRD 2014h). 

Ground and air ambulance services in the Project area are provided by Alberta Health Services. Alberta 
Health Services contracts 12 fixed-wing aircraft and has an affiliation agreement with Shock Trauma Air 
Rescue Society (STARS) to ensure air ambulance services are available throughout the province (Alberta 
Health Services 2014).  

During construction and operations of the proposed Project, workers may require the use of hospitals, 
health centres or medical clinics. Project-related medical incidents are rare, however, workers may need 
community health care services for everyday medical needs.  

The Northern Lights Regional Health Centre in Fort McMurray is the closest full-service hospital and health 
centre to the proposed Project. Services provided at the 96-bed facility include 24-hour emergency, 
laboratory, x-ray, mental health, general surgery, ambulatory care, rehabilitation, home care, speech 
language and community health (Alberta Health Services 2014, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation 2013).  

The Athabasca Healthcare Centre in the Town of Athabasca is an acute and continuing care facility that 
offers 2-hour emergency, laboratory, x-ray, pharmacy, rehabilitation and palliative care (Alberta Health 
Services 2014).  

Family and Community Support Services (FCSS) is a funding partnership between the province and 
municipalities or Métis Settlements which enables communities to provide social programs for individuals 
and families (Government of Alberta 2012b). The proposed Project is located in the Northeast region of the 
FCSS program with offices located in Fort McMurray, Athabasca and Lac La Biche (Government of 
Alberta 2012b).  

Addictions and mental health services are available in the communities of Fort McMurray, Lac La Biche 
and Athabasca (Alberta Health Services 2014).  

5.17.4 Waste Infrastructure 

The nearest solid waste facility to the proposed Project is the RM of Wood Buffalo Landfill located 8.5 km 
south of Fort McMurray on Highway 63. Recycling facilities are available in Fort McMurray (RM of Wood 
Buffalo 2014). The Fort McMurray Athabasca Water Treatment Plant is undergoing a major expansion, 
which will have to capacity to provide services for a population of 133,000 (RM of Wood Buffalo 2014). 

Lac La Biche County operates two landfills and five transfer sites in the southern portion of the county (Lac 
La Biche County 2014). A wastewater treatment plant services the Hamlet of Lac La Biche and is currently 
not accepting new sewage dumping accounts. A new Biological Nutrient Removal (BNR) Plant is currently 
under construction and the County of Lac La Biche will review the potential for new dumping accounts upon 
completion of the plant (Lac La Biche County 2014).

September 2014 / 496955/492475 

 
The County of Athabasca operates a transfer site and recycling facility 1 km north of the Town of Athabasca 
and the Athabasca Regional Landfill located 56 km north of the community (Athabasca Regional Waste 
Management Services Commission 2014). The Town of Athabasca is responsible for wastewater treatment 
in the community and consists of an aerated lagoon (Town of Athabasca 2012).  

The Swan Hills Treatment Centre is the nearest hazardous waste facility to the proposed Project. The 
facility is located 240 km southwest of the proposed Project has processed more than 295,000 metric 
tonnes of hazardous waste and over 2,000 different waste profiles (Swan Hills Treatment Centre 2014).  

5.17.5 Water Infrastructure 

The domestic water for Fort McMurray is supplied from the Athabasca River. The municipal treatment 
facilities use a multiple barrier approach that includes coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration and 
disinfection (RM of Wood Buffalo 2014). 

The Town of Athabasca also receives its domestic water from the Athabasca River. The reservoir has the 
capacity to store 6,956 m3 of treated water (Town of Athabasca 2012).  

5.17.6 Housing, Commercial Accommodations 

The total peak workforce during the construction phase of the Project is expected to be approximately 560 
workers and construction management staff. A temporary construction camp is being considered as an 
option for  on-site accommodations.  

Housing refers to the rental accommodation available in the Socio-economic RSA. Table 5.17.1 lists the 
number of rented dwellings and average monthly shelter costs for rented dwellings in the Socio-economic 
RSA. Notably, the average monthly shelter costs for rented dwellings in the RM of Wood Buffalo are almost 
double the provincial average (Statistics Canada 2013).

In general, commercial accommodation and camping facilities will not be needed to house workers during 
construction. Even so, prior to the commencement of construction, commercial accommodation may be 
needed to house personnel conducting planning and pre-construction activities. Accommodation options 
include hotels, motels, lodges, campgrounds and RV parks. The number of accommodation provided in 
this subsection are approximate and calculated based on the most current information available through 
desktop research. 

For the purpose of this ESA, fully-serviced campsites are defined as having electrical and water hookups, 
and either sewer hookups at the site, or a dumping station in the campground.  

There are approximately 23 hotels or motels, 2 bed and breakfasts and 2 lodges in Fort McMurray. The 
Urban Service Area also has four campgrounds/RV parks (RM of Wood Buffalo 2014, World Web 
Technologies Inc. 2014). The Hamlet of Conklin has one hotel, one motel, one bed and breakfast, one 
lodge and one campground (RM of Wood Buffalo 2014, World Web Technologies Inc. 2014). The Hamlet 
of Anzac has one campground (RM of Wood Buffalo 2014). The Hamlet of Lac La Biche has 6 hotels or 
motels, 3 bed and breakfasts and approximately 13 campgrounds in or nearby the community (World Web

Technologies Inc. 2014). The Town of Athabasca has seven hotels or motels and two campgrounds (World 
Web Technologies Inc. 2014). The Hamlet of Wandering River has one hotel and one motel (World Web 
Technologies Inc. 2014).  

5.17.7 Recreation Services 

In the RM of Wood Buffalo, Fort McMurray offers a range of indoor and outdoor recreation services including 
a 130 km trail system, basketball courts, cross-country ski trails, baseball diamonds, outdoor skating rinks, 
boat launches, dog parks, picnic areas, skateboard parks, soccer fields, spray parks, tennis courts, 
volleyball courts, a cricket pitch and running tracks (RM of Wood Buffalo 2014). The Hamlet of Anzac has 
a community meeting hall and several outdoor recreational facilities (RM of Wood Buffalo 2014).  

Lac La Biche County operates recreational facilities in the Hamlet of Lac La Biche including an aquatic 
centre, two field houses, outdoor skating rinks, ball diamonds, soccer fields, campgrounds and trails (Lac 
La Biche County 2014).  

Recreational facilities in the Town of Athabasca include a multiplex centre, pool, baseball diamonds, 
riverfront parks, community playgrounds and tennis courts (Town of Athabasca 2012).  

5.17.8 Educational Services 

Publicly funded education until the end of grade 12 is administered by school divisions in Alberta. The 
communities in the Socio-economic LSA are part of the Northland School Division No. 61. The school 
division provides services for over 2,500 students in 24 schools (Northland School Division No. 61 2014).  

Keyano College is located in Fort McMurray and provides a range of post-secondary programs and services 
for the population in the northeast region of Alberta (Keyano College 2014). The University of Alberta also 
offers programs that are delivered at Keyano College including an MBA in Natural Resources and Energy 
(University of Alberta 2014).  

Athabasca University is located in the Town of Athabasca offering undergraduate and graduate courses. 
Programs are offered in class settings or online to accommodate individuals that are employed while 
attending the university (Athabasca University 2013). Northern Lakes College (NLC) is also located in the 
Town of Athabasca. Programs offered at NLF include academic upgrading, trades apprenticeships, career 
training, university studies and workforce development (Northern Lakes College 2014).  

5.18 Navigation and Navigation Safety 

This subsection summarizes general patterns and potential interactions between navigation and navigation 
safety and the proposed Project in the HORU LSA and RSA (Figure 5.10). The potential Project-related 
effects and key mitigation pertaining to Navigation and Navigation Safety are discussed in Section 6.2.18. 

The spatial boundary of the HORU LSA is defined by a 2 km wide band centred on the construction right-of-
way (i.e., 1 km on both sides of the construction right-of-way centre line). The spatial boundary for the 
HORU RSA includes the RSA boundaries of water quality and quantity, fish and fish habitat, wetlands, 
vegetation, wildlife and wildlife habitat and heritage resources. The HORU LSA and RSA are described in 
greater detail in Section 6.2.12, including the rationale for the determination of these boundaries. 

The NEB defines navigable waters as follows: a navigable water will be considered as any body of water 
capable, in its natural state, of being navigated by floating vessels of any description for the purpose of 
transportation, recreation or commerce, and may also be a human-made feature such as a canal or 
reservoir (NEB 2014b). According to the Navigable Waters Protection Program Application Guide navigable 
water is defined as “…any body of water capable of being navigated by floating vessels of any description 
for the purpose of transportation, commerce or recreation. This includes both inland and coastal waters” 
(Transport Canada 2010a). The proposed pipeline crosses approximately 18 waterbodies, including 8 
watercourses, 4 fish-bearing drainages and 6 nonfish-bearing drainages. During the aquatic assessment, 
the potential to float a vessel (e.g., canoe) was considered at each of these 18 waterbodies based on criteria 
such as channel width, water depth and the presence of obstructions. Of the 18 waterbodies, 2 were 
determined to be navigable (WC6 and WC8 A and B) and 1 was determined to be potentially navigable

(WC4). However, impacts to navigation are not anticipated at any of these waterbodies as instream 
construction is scheduled to occur during the winter season, when waterbodies are expected to be ice 
covered or frozen.  

Table 5.18.1 outlines the watercourse that were deemed potentially navigable. 

TABLE 5.18.1 
 

POTENTIALLY NAVIGABLE WATERCOURSES CROSSED BY THE PIPELINE ROUTE 

Location Watercourse 
SE 29-81-16 (KP 35.1) House River trenchless crossing location (WC 8A) 
SE 29-81-16 (KP 35.2) House River trenched crossing contingency option (WC 8B) 
SW 4-81-15 (KP 21.9) Dropoff Creek (WC 6) 

NW 31-80-14 (KP 14.6) Unnamed Tributary to Dropoff Creek (WC 4) 
 

Project activities will not be located in, on, over, under, through or across a navigable waterway when water 
is flowing (i.e., not seasonally dry or frozen) and, therefore, additional detailed information on navigation 
and navigable safety is not warranted as per Table A-3 of the NEB Filing Manual (NEB 2014a). Watercourse 
crossing information, including data summaries and open water photos, is provided in Appendix 3. No 
designated Canadian Heritage Rivers are crossed by the proposed Project (Canadian Heritage Rivers 
System 2011). 

5.19 Employment and Economy 

This subsection summarizes general patterns and potential interactions between employment and 
economy and the proposed Project in the Socio-economic LSA and RSA (Figure 5.11). The potential 
Project-related effects and key mitigation pertaining to Employment and Economy are discussed in 
Section 6.2.19. 

The spatial boundary of the Socio-economic LSA is defined as the boundaries of communities, where it can 
reasonably be expected that direct effects from the proposed Project would occur. These communities 
include the Urban Service Area of Fort McMurray and the Town of Athabasca. The spatial boundary for the 
Socio-economic RSA consists of the boundaries of the RM of Wood Buffalo and Lac La Biche County. The 
Socio-economic LSA and RSA are described in greater detail in Section 6.2.15, including the rationale for 
the determination of these boundaries.  

5.19.1.1 Workforce Requirements 

While pipeline construction requires both skilled and unskilled labour, it is typically conducted over a short 
time period. Pending regulatory approval, construction activities such as clearing and grading activities are 
expected to begin at the compressor station site in May 2015 and continue until the anticipated in-service 
date of April 2016. See Section 2.4.7 (Table 2.7) for a detailed construction schedule. The peak construction 
workforce is estimated to be approximately 560skilled labourers and operators, and 50 inspection and 
quality assurance personnel.  

5.19.1.2 Contracting Opportunities 

Contracts for construction activities will be awarded and conducted under the direction of the Prime 
Contractor. All successful subcontractors will need to meet NGTL’s safety and quality requirements, and 
be cost competitive. NGTL has been working collaboratively with communities to identify individuals and 
businesses that could potentially provide services to the project. Where training is necessary, in order for 
communities to take advantage of opportunities, NGTL, the Prime Contractor and the community will 
participate in the development and implementation of the necessary training. 

NGTL will continue to seek qualified service providers and suppliers from the local area to support the 
construction phase of the proposed Project. The services that are being sought through these arrangements 
include accommodations, transportation, aggregate supply, food services, temporary site facilities (e.g., site

trailers, washrooms), site preparation and pipe stockpile areas. In addition, NGTL will facilitate opportunities 
for local contractors to bid on portions of the proposed Project as a subcontractor to the Prime Contractor, 
such as right-of-way clearing, general labour, fuel supply and equipment maintenance and final clean-up. 
For the Project, NGTL’s goal for contract awards to local and regional businesses is 15% of the estimated 
construction value. 

5.19.1.3 Employment Opportunities 

Employment opportunities associated with the Project will be directed through the Prime Contractor. NGTL 
will provide the Prime Contractor with a list of locations, where local businesses are available to provide 
services. NGTL is committed to working with Aboriginal communities and businesses to provide 
opportunities to participate in the construction of the Project. This includes access to employment 
opportunities. The successful Prime Contractor is expected to support NGTL’s commitment to Aboriginal 
people. 

NGTL encourages local participation and job training through partnering with suppliers and vendors who 
have established local hiring and job training programs (e.g., PTI Group’s job training program). 

5.19.1.4 Existing Local and Regional Employment 

The National Household Survey (NHS) defines the workforce population as those of ages 15 years and 
older while previously the workforce population was defined as those of ages 15 years to 64 years. In 
addition, for some smaller communities and some Aboriginal communities, certain Census of Canada and 
NHS data from Statistics Canada are suppressed, rounded or otherwise not made available for 
confidentiality reasons. NHS data for the Urban Service Area of Fort McMurray was not available although 
information for the community is included in the RM of Wood Buffalo.  

Statistical data for unincorporated hamlets and communities are amalgamated into the county or region in 
which they are geographically located and by which they are administered. As such, unincorporated 
hamlets and communities are not identified as study area communities. Information on key unincorporated 
hamlets and communities that may be directly affected by the proposed Project is presented where 
available.  

Information about the labour force, employment and unemployment rates, and totals of those employed in 
the agricultural and resource-based industries is presented in Table 5.19.1. As of 2011, the RM of Wood 
Buffalo had an unemployment rate of 4.7%, which is lower than the provincial average of 5.8%. Both the 
County of Lac La Biche and the Town of Athabasca had unemployment rates higher than the provincial 
average of 6.4% and 7.1%, respectively (Statistics Canada 2013).

Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo 
The present economy of the RM of Wood Buffalo is characterized by oil sands development with most of 
the goods and services associated with the oil sands being imported to the region. Retail, commercial and 
professional services are experiencing challenges in meeting the demands of consumers. The physical and 
social infrastructure of the region are experiencing similar challenges due to the growing population (RM of 
Wood Buffalo 2010a).  

The 2010-2014 Economic Development Strategy attempts to address the aforementioned challenges 
facing the RM of Wood Buffalo (RM of Wood Buffalo 2010a). While the oil sands industry remains the 
primary sector, the envisioned economy of the region will become more diversified with the region directly 
providing more of the goods and services. Improved physical and social infrastructure will encourage 
residents to both live and work in the region (RM of Wood Buffalo 2010a).  

Due to the objective for increased business diversification, the RM of Wood Buffalo completed a regional 
business inventory and gap analysis (RM of Wood Buffalo 2010b). The business inventory for the RM of 
Wood Buffalo included 5,107 records in a variety of sectors. The identified gaps in the business profile 
included: accommodation and food services; arts, entertainment and recreation; health care and social 
assistance; educational services, finance and insurance and retail trade (RM of Wood Buffalo 2010b).  

Lac La Biche County 
Economic activity in Lac La Biche County is primarily based on resource extraction activities including 
forestry and oil and gas development (Lac La Biche County 2013). It is anticipated that steam-assisted 
gravity drainage (SAGD) development for in-site oil sands extraction in the northeast of the county will 
continue to increase, acting as the main economic driver (Lac La Biche County 2013).  

Town of Athabasca 
The economy of the Town of Athabasca is based on agriculture, natural gas, forestry and tourism. 
Agriculture has typically been the main economic driver although its importance has diminished in recent 
years (Alberta Community Profiles 2014). The retail and service sectors in the community have expanded 
in response to industry development in the area. The largest employer in the community is the Athabasca 
University (Alberta Community Profiles 2014).
