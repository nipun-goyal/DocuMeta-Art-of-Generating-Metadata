6.0 ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC EFFECTS ASSESSMENT 
The description of the environmental and socio-economic setting (current state of the environment) within 
the Project area (Section 5.0), is compared in this section of the ESA against the Project Description 
(Section 2.0) to assess potential environmental and socio-economic effects that might be caused by the 
Project. The environmental and socio-economic effects assessment uses the information provided in the 
environmental and socio-economic setting and Project Description to: 

• evaluate the environmental and socio-economic elements of importance in the Project 
area; 

• identify the potential effects of the environment on the Project;  

• develop appropriate technically and economically feasible site-specific mitigation 
measures; and 

• identify and evaluate potential Project effects associated with each environmental and 
socio-economic element of importance. 

In addition, the environmental and socio-economic effects assessment has determined the significance of 
potential residual effects resulting from construction and operation activities after taking into consideration 
proposed mitigation. NGTL has informed TERA that it will adopt the recommendations herein. 

6.1 Methodology 

The assessment evaluated the environmental and socio-economic effects of the construction, operation 
and decommissioning or abandonment phases of each component of the Project. The assessment method 
included the following components: 

• determination of spatial and temporal boundaries for the assessment; 

• identification of environmental and socio-economic elements; 

• identification of potential environmental and socio-economic effects; 

• development of appropriate technically and economically feasible site-specific mitigation; 

• identification of anticipated residual effects; and 

• determination of the significance of residual effects. 

This environmental and socio-economic effects assessment methodology has been developed based on 
the following: 

• the Responsible Authority’s Guide to the CEA Act: Part II The Practitioner’s Guide 
(Federal Environmental Assessment Review Office [FEARO] 1994a); 

• FEARO’s A Reference Guide for the CEA Act: Addressing Cumulative Environmental 
Effects (FEARO 1994b); 

• FEARO’s A Reference Guide for the CEA Act: Determining Whether a Project is Likely to 
Cause Significant Environmental Effects (FEARO 1994c); 

• the CEA Agency’s Cumulative Effects Assessment Practitioners Guide 
(Hegmann et al. 1999); 

• the CEA Agency’s Incorporating Climate Change Considerations in Environmental 
Assessment (CEA Agency 2003);  

• the CEA Agency’s Assessing Cumulative Environmental Effects under the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 (CEA Agency 2013b); and 

• the NEB Filing Manual (NEB 2014a). 

The environmental and socio-economic effects assessment associated with the construction and operation 
of the Project was a collaborative effort of several qualified professionals with element-specific expertise.

6.1.1 Spatial and Temporal Boundaries 

Spatial Boundaries 
The spatial boundaries used to evaluate the potential effects of the Project on the environment are 
presented in Section 1.4 and in Table 5.1 for each applicable element. 

Individually established ecological boundaries are described in Section 6.2 for each applicable biological 
element. Spatial ecological boundaries were determined by the distribution, movement patterns and 
potential zones of interaction between an element and the Project. The ecological boundary may be limited 
to the Footprint (e.g., proposed pipeline construction right-of-way, temporary workspace, valve sites 
associated with the pipeline and meter station, and access road at the meter station) or extend beyond the 
physical boundaries of the area of the Project component since the distribution or movement of an element 
can be local, regional or provincial, national, or international in extent. 

Temporal Boundaries 
The time frames used in the assessment of the Project included the planning, construction, operation, or 
decommissioning or abandonment phases (Table 6.1). The construction phase includes surveying, 
clearing, strippings salvage, grading, trenching, installation of Project components (e.g., pipeline and meter 
station), testing, and reclamation for the Project. Project construction activities are assumed to begin in 
Q4 2015 with an in-service date of Q2 2016. A detailed construction schedule for the Project is provided in 
Section 2.0. The operation phase was considered to commence following completion of construction in 
Q2 2016 and extend for a term estimated to exceed 40 years. 
 

6.1.2 Environmental and Socio-Economic Elements 

The potential environmental (i.e., biophysical) and socio-economic elements interacting with the Project 
were identified through the Aboriginal engagement program, the public, regulatory and government 
consultation process, experience gained during previous pipeline projects with similar conditions/potential 
issues (e.g., NGTL’s Musreau Cutbank Expansion Project, Sunday Creek South Lateral Loop No. 3 Pipeline 
Project, Cutbank/Musreau Area Expansion [Red Rock Section] and the Cutbank River Lateral Loop [Bald 
Mountain Section] Project), as well as the professional judgement of the assessment team. Issues noted 
during consultation with federal, provincial and municipal government agencies, local industry 
representatives, Aboriginal communities, interested stakeholders and the general public were essential in 
determining element interactions with the Project (Section 3.0). 

Environmental and socio-economic elements potentially interacting with the Project include: 

• physical elements such as the physical and meteorological environment, soil and soil 
productivity, water quality and quantity, air emissions, GHG emissions and the acoustic 
environment; 

• biological elements such as fish and fish habitat, wetlands, vegetation, wildlife and wildlife 
habitat and species at risk; and 

• socio-economic elements such as human occupancy and resource use, heritage 
resources, traditional land and resource use, social and cultural well-being, human health, 
infrastructure and services, navigation and navigation safety, and employment and 
economy. 

Effects arising from potential accidents and malfunctions and effects of the environment on the Project were 
also considered. 

Those environmental and socio-economic elements which are not considered to interact with the Project 
are identified and discussed in Sections 6.2 and 6.3. In accordance with Guide A.2.6 of the NEB Filing 
Manual, no further analysis is necessary for those elements where interactions between the Project 
component and an environmental or socio-economic element are not predicted.

 Page 6-3  

 
 

6.1.3 Potential Environmental and Socio-Economic Effects 

Guide A.2.6.1 of the NEB Filing Manual assumes that identification of potential environmental and 
socio-economic effects reflects a valued component-based approach where the valued components could 
be the broad elements as described in Tables A-1 Circumstances and Interactions Requiring Detailed 
Biophysical and Socio-economic Information, A-2 Filing Requirements for Biophysical Elements and A-3 
Filing Requirements for Socio-economic Elements or a representative subset of those elements. Given the 
scope of the Project, the identification of the potential environmental and socio-economic effects focuses 
on the broad environmental (i.e., biophysical) and socio-economic elements as the valued components. 

The potential environmental and socio-economic effects resulting from the Project were identified through 
consultation with Aboriginal communities, the public, government and regulatory agencies 
engagement/consultation process, experience gained during previous pipeline projects with similar 
conditions and potential issues (e.g., NGTL’s Musreau Cutbank Expansion Project, Sunday Creek South 
Lateral Loop No. 3 Pipeline Project, Cutbank/Musreau Area Expansion [Red Rock Section] and the Cutbank 
River Lateral Loop [Bald Mountain Section] Project), and the professional judgement of the assessment 
team. The potential environmental and socio-economic effects arising from the construction and operation 
of the Project and associated temporary facilities are identified in Sections 6.2 and 6.3. 

As previously noted, the Project site is located entirely on Crown-owned land. The use, disposition and 
protection of Provincially-controlled Crown lands within the MD of Greenview is an important issue as these 
lands accommodate major economic activities supporting the MD (e.g., oil and gas development). In 
regards to development within the Crown Land District, the objective of the MDP is to cooperate with the 
respective Provincial Government departments (i.e., AESRD) in the planning and development processes 
as a means of ensuring the interests of the MD of Greenview are recognized and reflected. Additionally, 
the MD of Greenview acknowledges that developments subject to government permits (see Table 2.2) will 
address the environmental matters of concern within the municipal boundaries (i.e., waterbodies, special 
habitat features). Therefore, the local and regional objectives outlined in the MDP were not considered 
further in the assessment.  

6.1.4 Mitigation Measures 

Mitigation, as defined under the CEA Act, 2012, is considered to be the elimination, reduction or control of 
a project’s adverse environmental effects, including restitution for any damage to the environment caused 
by such effects through replacement, restoration, compensation or any other means. This definition also 
applies to reducing or managing a project’s adverse socio-economic effects.  

To ensure that the severity of potential adverse environmental and socio-economic effects are reduced and 
potential positive socio-economic effects are enhanced during Project construction and operation, general 
and site-specific mitigation measures have been recommended based upon current industry-accepted 
standards, consultation/engagement with regulatory agencies, interested groups, individuals and Aboriginal 
communities, and the professional judgement of the assessment team.  

Many of the mitigation measures in this ESA have been discussed with Aboriginal communities that have 
participated in biophysical field studies. A comprehensive review of all the issues that have been raised by 
each community and the mitigation or enhancement measures proposed will be conducted. Meetings were 
arranged following the biophysical field studies to confirm the issues identified and to review the proposed 
mitigation measures (Section 3.0). The issues identified by participating Aboriginal communities through 
TLU studies and biophysical field studies for the Project are summarized in the TK Report (Appendix 8).  

Mitigation measures are identified in Section 6.2, as well as in the Project-specific EPP (Appendix 1). In 
addition, various requirements and guidelines of federal and provincial regulatory agencies, and industry 
standards and guidelines have been taken into consideration in this ESA, and the applicable documents 
are referenced for each element. 

Accompanying this ESA are Photomosaic Environmental Alignment Sheets (Appendix 2), which identify 
where some site-specific mitigation measures are to be implemented. Environmental Inspector(s) will be 
retained by NGTL to help ensure that the mitigation measures within this ESA are understood and properly 
implemented during construction. Environmental inspection is further described in Section 8.0. In addition,

it is expected that through the ongoing consultation program (e.g., consultation guidelines and protocols for 
Aboriginal communities), additional issues related to the Project may be identified and further mitigation 
measures developed. 

NGTL adopts all of TransCanada’s plans and policies for the purposes of the Project. 

6.1.5 Residual Effects 

Residual effects are the environmental and socio-economic effects remaining following the implementation 
of mitigation measures. In many situations, the recommended mitigation measures will completely mitigate 
the potential adverse effects while in other situations, the mitigation measures will lessen the effects, 
however, do not entirely eliminate the effects. Elements for which no residual effects are predicted require 
no further analysis. 

6.1.6 Significance Evaluation of Potential Residual Effects 

The determination of significance of potential residual effects generally followed the guidelines and 
principles of the NEB Filing Manual, FEARO’s The Responsible Authority’s Guide to the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act: Part II: The Practitioner’s Guide (FEARO 1994a), FEARO’s A Reference 
Guide for the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act: Assessing Cumulative Environmental Effects 
(FEARO 1994b), FEARO’s A Reference Guide for the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act: 
Determining Whether a Project is Likely to Cause Significant Environmental Effects (FEARO 1994c), and 
CEA Agency’s Cumulative Effects Assessment Practitioners Guide (Hegmann et al. 1999). The agencies 
identify several possible methods for the determination of whether residual environmental or 
socio-economic effects are significant. These include: 

• the use of regulatory environmental standards, guidelines or objectives in relation to 
potential residual effects; 

• quantitative assessment of residual effects; and 

• qualitative assessment of the residual effects. 

The NEB Filing Manual indicates that the quantitative method should be used where possible; otherwise, 
the qualitative method can be used. Some elements can be assessed quantitatively using regulatory 
standards and guidelines. Where there are no standards, guidelines, objectives or other established and 
accepted thresholds to define quantitative rating criteria or where quantitative thresholds are not 
appropriate, the qualitative method that is based on available literature is considered to be the appropriate 
method for determining the significance of most of the potential residual effects. 

Consequently, the significance is evaluated by developing a set of qualitative criteria based on those 
identified by Hegmann et al. (1999). These criteria are identified below and their definitions are presented 
in Table 6.1. In some cases, the definitions were modified to accommodate discipline-specific parameters.  

• Spatial boundary (i.e., Footprint, LSA, RSA, International). 

• Temporal context (i.e., duration and frequency of the event causing the residual effect, reversibility of 
the residual effect). 

• Magnitude (i.e., severity of the residual effect in relation to environmental, social and/or regulatory 
standards). 

• Level of confidence or uncertainty (i.e., availability of data to substantiate the assessment conclusion, 
previous success of mitigation measures, etc.). 

• Probability or likelihood of occurrence of the residual effect.

Ecological context (e.g., levels of existing disturbance; resilience of the receiving environment) is not 
included in Table 6.1. However, the ecological context is provided in Section 6.2 for each applicable 
element. 

For environmental elements, a significant residual effect has a high probability of occurrence, is permanent 
or reversible in the long-term, is of high magnitude and cannot be technically or economically mitigated.  

For socio-economic elements, a residual effect is considered significant if the effect is predicted to be: 

• high magnitude, high probability, short to medium-term reversibility and regional, in extent 
and cannot be technically or economically mitigated; or 

• high magnitude, high probability, long-term or permanent reversibility, within any spatial 
boundary and cannot be technically or economically mitigated. 

As previously mentioned in Section 6.1.4, mitigation is considered to be the elimination, reduction or control 
of a project’s adverse environmental effects, including restitution for any damage to the environment caused 
by such effects through replacement, restoration, compensation or any other means. 

For each environmental and socio-economic residual effect, the effect balance or direction 
(i.e., determination as to whether the effect is positive or negative) was also established. A positive effect 
balance is considered to have a net benefit to the environment or socio-economic conditions. A neutral 
balance is defined as no net benefit or loss to the environment or socio-economic conditions, while a 
negative balance is considered to be a net loss or detriment to the environment or socio-economic 
conditions. 

All significance assessment criteria (e.g., temporal context, magnitude, etc.) were considered by the 
assessment team for each residual environmental or socio-economic effect but the most influential 
assessment criteria were reversibility, magnitude and probability. Where appropriate, the key or most 
influential assessment criteria used to determine the significance of each residual effect are noted. 
Table 6.1 presents the criteria used to evaluate the significance of residual effects identified and the 
definitions.

Assessment Criteria Definition 
LSA The LSA varies with the environment and resource use related socio-economic 

element being considered. For each element considered, the LSA is established 
based on the ZOI within which plants, animals and humans are most likely to be 
affected by Project construction and operation. Detailed discussions regarding 
the LSA and associated rationale are provided in Sections 6.2. For social 
elements (e.g., human occupancy and resource use), local potential effects are 
related to specific communities that could be reasonably considered in the 
socio-economic assessment. The communities considered were based on 
whether there would be direct potential effects, such as a physical, social or 
economic interaction between the Project and the community or community 
residents and their economic, social or cultural resources and pursuits. The 
communities considered in the LSA include the Town of Grande Cache, the 
Hamlet of Landry Heights, the Hamlet of Grovedale, the Town of Wembley and 
the City of Grande Prairie. Aboriginal communities considered in the ESA 
include Horse Lake First Nation, Sturgeon Lake Cree Nation, Nose Creek 
Settlement, Kelly Lake Cree Nation, Kelly Lake First Nation, Kelly Lake Métis 
Settlement Society, Aseniwuche Winewak Nation of Canada, Grande Cache 
Métis Local #1994, Métis Nation of Alberta Association Region 4, and Métis 
Nation of Alberta Association Region 6.  

RSA The RSA consists of the area extending beyond the LSA boundary and varies 
with the environment and resource use related socio-economic element being 
considered. For each element considered, a separate RSA boundary was 
established in consideration of the Project regional effects on the individual 
element. Further rationale for the establishment of the Project RSAs is 
provided in Section 6.2.

Notes: 1 Significant Residual Environmental Effect: A high probability of occurrence of a permanent or 
long-term residual effect of high magnitude that cannot be technically or economically mitigated.  

  Significant Residual Socio-economic Effect: A residual socio-economic effect is considered 
significant if the effect is predicted to be: 

 - high magnitude, high probability, short to medium-term reversibility and regional, provincial or 
national in extent that cannot be technically or economically mitigated; or 

 - high magnitude, high probability, long-term or permanent reversibility and any spatial boundary that 
cannot be technically or economically mitigated. 

 2 The assessment period for the effects assessment includes planning, construction, operation, and 
decommissioning and abandonment phases for the Project while the assessment period for the 
cumulative effects assessment includes the above interval as well as the development, construction and 
operation phases of activities or projects that have previously occurred and those that are planned 
(publicly disclosed). 

 3 In consideration of magnitude, there is no environmental standard, threshold, guideline or objective for 
many of the construction/operation issues under evaluation. Therefore, the determination of magnitude 
of the adverse residual effect often entailed a historical consideration of the assessment of magnitude 
made by regulators, land authorities, lessees, other stakeholders and the assessment team to adverse 
effects. The assessment team was also aware of the increasingly stringent societal norms related to 
environmental effects. 

 4 Level of confidence was affected by availability of data, precedence, and degree of scientific uncertainty 
or other factors beyond the control of the assessment team. 

 

An evaluation of combined adverse residual effects or combined positive residual effects has been 
conducted for those elements where more than one identified potential adverse effect or positive residual 
effect may occur at a particular location. The evaluation of the combined effects considers only those 
residual effects that are likely to occur (i.e., of high probability). A discussion of the combined effects has

been included in the significance evaluation to provide further understanding of the overall effect of the 
Project on the element in question. 

The extent to which professional judgement of the assessment team was used in the evaluation of 
significance of potential environmental and socio-economic residual effects is provided for each element. 
For this Project, the assessment team consisted of discipline experts, experienced assessment 
practitioners and senior reviewers.  

A summary of the significance evaluation for residual environmental and socio-economic effects arising 
from the construction and operation of the proposed pipeline and associated pipeline facilities is provided 
in Sections 6.2 and 6.3. 

6.2 Effects Assessment - Project Construction and Operation 

Using the assessment methodology described in Section 6.1, the following subsections evaluate the 
potential environmental and socio-economic effects associated with the construction and operation of the 
Project. An assessment of effects arising from temporary facility construction and operation is provided in 
Section 6.3. 

Environmental and socio-economic elements potentially interacting with construction and operation of the 
pipeline (i.e., construction right-of-way, temporary workspace for construction, associated valve sites) and 
meter station including the pipeline tie-in and access road) are identified in Table 6.2.

A Physical Environment LSA (Figure 6.1) was established to incorporate the area in which the physical and 
meteorological environment is most likely to be affected by Project construction and operation. The Physical 
Environment LSA is defined as the ZOI likely to be affected by terrain instability during construction and 
operation of the Project, consisting of a 1 km wide band centred on the proposed pipeline route centre line 
(i.e., 500 m on both sides of the centre line) and 500 m around the perimeter of the meter station to 
incorporate effects that may extend off the Footprint (e.g., water erosion on slopes). This spatial extent is 
considered sufficient for consideration of potential effects to the physical and meteorological environment 
as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed pipeline and meter station. Potential effects 
are not anticipated to extend beyond the Physical Environment LSA and, therefore, a Physical Environment 
RSA has not been established.  

The study area boundaries for the Physical Environment LSA have been used to define the spatial boundary 
for the Soils LSA based on the extent of the related effects of both of these environmental elements. Further 
details regarding the Soils LSA are provided in Section 6.2.2.1.

6.2.1.2 Physical Environment Context 

The general topography of the area is characterized by rolling uplands and foothills, and dissected plateaus 
(Natural Regions Committee 2006). The Project is not located in an area that is subject to permafrost 
formation and is not located near any areas in which there have been recorded occurrences of instability 
(NRCan 2009b-e). The meter station and associated infrastructure (i.e., valve site, tie-in and access road) 
is located on stable, level terrain. There are moderately steep slopes associated with the pipeline route at 
all watercourse crossings (see Appendix 4).

6.2.1.3 Potential Effects, Mitigation Measures and Potential Residual Effects 

The potential effects associated with the construction and operation of the Project on the physical and 
meteorological environment were identified by the assessment team and are listed in Table 6.3. Since the 
meter station is located on stable, level terrain, no potential effects associated with the construction and 
operation of the meter station, valve site or permanent access road are anticipated, therefore, these 
components are not considered further in this section. 

A summary of mitigation measures provided in Table 6.3 were principally developed in accordance with 
industry and regulatory guidelines made available by the Government of Alberta (AENV 1988, 1994a,b) 
and Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) (1999), as well as in accordance with NGTL 
standards.

6.2.1.4 Significance Evaluation of Potential Residual Effects 

A qualitative assessment was considered the most appropriate method to evaluate the significance of 
potential residual effects on the physical and meteorological environment, due to the lack of quantitative 
data and accepted standards, guidelines and ecological thresholds. This qualitative assessment relied on 
available research literature and the professional judgement of the assessment team.  

Table 6.4 provides a summary of the significance evaluation of potential residual environmental effects of 
the construction and operation of the Project on the physical and meteorological environment. The rationale 
used to evaluate the significance of each of the residual environmental effects is provided below. Effects of 
the environment on the Project (i.e., wildfire, floods and changes in weather trends) are discussed in 
Section 6.5.

medium-term and is, therefore, not significant. 

Note:  Significant Residual Environmental Effect: A high probability of occurrence of a permanent or long-term 
residual effect of high magnitude that cannot be technically or economically mitigated. 

 

Terrain Instability 
Minor areas of terrain instability may occur along segments of the pipeline route as a result of the pipeline 
construction activities (e.g., trenching, grading). The impact balance of this residual effect is considered 
negative since terrain instability could affect the integrity of the pipe. The construction of the pipeline will 
comply with provincial and federal regulatory guidelines and industry-accepted practices and measures 
outlined in the EPP. Areas of potential terrain instability will be specifically monitored for two years after 
construction with subsequent routine monitoring during aerial patrols over the life of the pipeline and 
promptly remediated, where warranted, to protect pipeline integrity and maintain stable landscape contours. 
The residual effect of terrain instability occurring as a result of planned construction activities is reversible 
in the short-term and of low magnitude since any unstable terrain identified is expected to be fully 
restabilized in less than one year following remediation activities (Table 6.4, point [a]).  

Slope Instability Arising from Slumping at Watercourse Crossings 
Areas of slope instability may occur where a trenched crossing method is used at watercourse crossings. 
The impact balance of this residual effect is considered negative since slope instability could affect the 
integrity of the pipe and water quality of the watercourses (see Section 6.2.3). Isolated or dry open-cut 
construction methods are planned for all watercourse crossings along the pipeline route, with the exception

of Bald Mountain Creek (WC1) (Appendix 3). Mitigation measures to prevent and control slope instability 
during construction will be implemented. The residual effect of slope instability at trenched watercourse 
crossings is of low probability given proper isolated trenched crossing procedures and the mitigation 
measures outlined in Table 6.3. This potential effect is reversible in the short to medium-term depending 
on the length of time required to restabilize the affected area (Table 6.4, point [b]).  

6.2.1.5 Summary 

As identified in Table 6.4, there are no situations where there is a high probability of occurrence of a 
permanent or long-term residual environmental effect on the physical and meteorological environment of 
high magnitude that cannot be technically or economically mitigated. Consequently, it is concluded that the 
residual environmental effects of the Project construction and operation on the physical and meteorological 
environment will be not significant. 

6.2.2 Soil and Soil Productivity 

6.2.2.1 Spatial Boundaries 

The spatial boundaries used in the effects assessment of soils and soil productivity considered one or more 
of the following areas: 

• a Footprint Study Area (as defined in Section 1.4); and 

• a Soils LSA. 

A Soils LSA (Figure 6.1) was established to consider the area in which Project construction and operation 
activities would most likely have an effect on soils and soil productivity. Based on a close correlation and 
relationship between the effects of the Project to both the physical environment and soils (i.e., construction 
activities), the spatial boundary of the Physical Environment LSA was used to define the spatial boundary 
of the Soils LSA as the ZOI likely to be affected by terrain instability during construction and operation of 
the Project. The Soils LSA consists of a 1 km wide band centred on the proposed pipeline route centre line 
(i.e., 500 m on both sides of the centre line) and 500 m around the perimeter of the meter station. This 
spatial extent is deemed sufficient for consideration of potential effects to soils and soil productivity as a 
result of the construction and operation of the Project. Potential effects are not anticipated to extend beyond 
the Soils LSA and, therefore, a Soils RSA has not been established.  

6.2.2.2 Soil Context 

The Project is located within the Western Alberta Upland Ecoregion of the Boreal Plains Ecozone. Historical 
and current land use in the ecoregion includes forestry, agriculture, and oil and gas development 
(Environment Canada 2010). 

The proposed pipeline route encounters the Donnelly soil group in the most northern portion 
(Township 68 W6M), the Copton soil groups (Townships 67 and 66 W6M) and both the Torrens and Smoky 
soil groups (Township 65 W6M) (Twardy and Corns 1980). The meter station encounters the Edson soil 
group.  

The pipeline route will parallel existing disturbances for approximately 78% of its length. Potential 
contaminants of concern may be present from previous pipeline construction activities or may occur during 
construction and maintenance activities associated with this Project. These may include compounds 
routinely used in construction, such as fusion bond epoxy, liquid epoxy pipe coating, paint and 
hydrocarbons. 

6.2.2.3 Potential Effects, Mitigation Measures and Potential Residual Effects 

The potential effects associated with the construction and operation of the Project on soil and soil 
productivity were identified by the assessment team and are listed in Table 6.5.

Footprint Strippings Salvage  
• Before the start of construction, the 

Environmental Inspector(s) shall review the 
Contractor’s preliminary grade plan to ensure 
environmental resources are not 
compromised as a result of grading 
[Section 6.0].  

• Do not conduct strippings salvage except 
where grading is required [Appendix 1D, 
Dwg. STDS-03-ML-05-444A, 
STDS-03-ML-05-444B, Dwgs. 1 and 2] 
[Section 8.3]. 

• At locations where the organic layer has been 
stripped, place spoil in a manner that allows 
the spoil to be replaced separately from the 
organic material [Section 8.5]. 

• Grub tree roots, where required with a hoe 
and thumb or alternate equipment to 
preserve surface organic material 
[Section 8.2]. 

• Do not mix snow with spoil material during 
backfill [Section 8.5]. 

• Complete machine clean-up immediately 
following construction, prior to spring 
break-up. If machine clean-up cannot be 
completed prior to spring breakup, ensure 
cross right-of-way drainage is re-established, 
and sedimentation and erosion controls are 
installed to protect the right-of-way and 
sensitive environmental features. Final 
clean-up and reclamation will generally occur 
during the following fall and/or winter, or as 
soon as conditions permit [Section 8.8]. 

Strippings Replacement 
• Replace strippings evenly over all portions of 

the right-of-way that were stripped or portions 
of the meter station that will not be gravelled 
over [Section 8.8]. 

• Postpone replacement of strippings during 
wet conditions to prevent erosion and/or 
damage soil structure [Section 8.8]. 

Strippings Storage 
• Ensure strippings storage areas are in 

approved right-of-way, meter station and 
temporary workspace [Section 8.3]. 

• If wet/thawed soil conditions occur, 
implement the Wet Soils Contingency Plan 
[Appendix 1E] [Section 8.3]. 

• Mixing of 
strippings 
and subsoil 
due to 
strippings 
salvage 
activities or 
burial during 
trenching

strippings 
salvage did 
not occur

with the Construction Manager may 
implement contingency measures as outlined 
in the Adverse Weather Contingency Plan 
[Appendix 1E]. Regulatory personnel may be

Footprint • Stabilize exposed strippings and subsoil 
where potential for erosion exists. Refer to 
the Soil Erosion Contingency Plan 
[Appendix 1E] for additional information 
[Section 8.3]. 

• Install cross ditches and berms on 
moderately steep and steep slopes in order 
to prevent runoff along the right-of-way and 
subsequent erosion. Install berms 
immediately downslope of all trench breakers 
(Dwg. STDS-03-ML-12-221) [Section 8.8]. 

• Re-establish surface drainage patterns; 
install drainage and erosion control 
measures, and complete the installation of 
sedimentation control measures at all 
watercourse crossings [Section 8.8]. 

• Leave openings in the trench crown and all 
windrows at appropriate locations to allow for 
temporary and permanent cross right-of-way 
drainage [Section 8.6]. 

• Seed riparian and erosion prone areas with a 
native cover crop and seed mix that has been 
approved by the applicable regulatory 
agency. Seeding will follow as close as 
possible to rough clean-up and surface 
material replacement pending seasonal or 
weather conditions [Section 8.8]. 

• Rollback coarse woody debris and small 
diameter, non-merchantable timber on 
erosion prone slopes when deemed 
necessary by the Environmental Inspector. 
Walk down erosion control rollback with a 
dozer [Appendix 1D, 
Dwg. STDS-03-ML-05-312] [Section 8.8].  

• Areas of potential terrain instability will be 
monitored for 2 years following construction. 
Slope stability will be inspected on a routine 
basis for the life of the pipeline. Remedial 
work will be conducted where warranted to 
protect pipeline integrity [Section 9.0].

6.2.2.4 Significance Evaluation of Potential Residual Effects 

A qualitative assessment was considered the most appropriate method to evaluate the significance of 
potential residual effects on soil and soil productivity, due to the lack of quantitative data and accepted 
standards, guidelines and ecological thresholds. This qualitative assessment relied on available research 
literature and the professional judgement of the assessment team.  

Table 6.6 provides a summary of the significance evaluation of potential residual environmental effects of 
the construction and operation of the Project on soil and soil productivity. The rationale used to evaluate 
the significance of each of the above residual environmental effects is provided below. An evaluation of 
significance is not required for those potential effects where no residual effect is identified (i.e., degradation 
of soil structure and lowering of soil capability through compaction and rutting, soil contamination and the 
effects on soil as a result of the release of hydrostatic test water on land).

several years (i.e., pipeline rights-of-way and valve sites). 
Gravelled areas at the meter station and permanent access 
will require that strippings be salvaged, stored and then 
replaced in the long-term. 

Magnitude: Low • Since the risk of strippings being buried is limited to the 
trench line areas requiring grading and because the minimal 
disturbance approach proposed by NGTL is acceptable to 
AESRD, it is considered to be within environmental 
standards and consequently, of low magnitude.

Strippings and Subsoil Mixing or Burial 
During construction of the Project, it is likely that some strippings/subsoil mixing or burial will occur. The 
report Soil Series Information for Reclamation Planning in Alberta Vol. 1 (Pedocan Land Evaluation 
Ltd. 1993) states that there may be a benefit in mixing the upper layer with the subsoil layer 
(i.e., overstripping) to create the best seedbed quality. However, some soil productivity may be lost when 
strippings/subsoil mixing results in loss of seedbed (on upland soils), change in water holding capacity or 
impacts drainage (on peatland soils), which is considered, on balance, a negative impact.  

NGTL has adopted a minimal surface disturbance technique for pipeline construction. Consequently, 
salvage of strippings will only be conducted where grading is required. NGTL considers strippings the 
surface organic material (i.e., duff or leaf litter). In segments of the pipeline route where strippings salvage 
is not conducted (i.e., flat and level terrain within upland forest, mineral wetlands and peatlands) disturbance 
will be limited to the trench line, with the intent to leave the vegetated root mat and seedbed intact on the 
remainder of the right-of-way. On soils associated with peatlands, little to no strippings salvage is planned, 
since these locations are typically flat/level terrain, where no grading is typically required.  

Trench material is excavated with the surface organic layer and mineral soil excavated and stored together. 
Admixing typically occurs during ditch trenching. However, prior to trenching, snow piled over the trench 
area is removed and stored on the edge on the spoil side of the pipeline right-of-way. During this snow 
removal, some underlying organic material is inevitably taken up and mixed with the snow. Surface organics 
removed during snow removal prior to trenching is spread over the right-of-way following backfill activities. 
These surface organics together with the organics in the trench backfill provides a base for regeneration of 
natural vegetation. 

The surface organic material at the meter station will be stripped prior to construction. Gravelled areas 
within the meter station and the permanent access road will require strippings be salvaged, stored and then 
replaced in the long-term.  

Past project experience has shown that soil productivity (i.e., ability to support vegetation species) will return 
on non-gravelled areas as a result of natural processes (e.g., leaf litter, organic debris, native plant 
encroachment, etc.) over several years (i.e., reversed in the medium-term) depending on the amount of 
organic material, growing conditions and development of the leaf litter. Since the area of admixing is limited 
to the trench line and graded areas and the minimal disturbance approach proposed by NGTL is acceptable 
to AESRD, it is considered to be within environmental standards and, consequently, of low magnitude 
(Table 6.6, point [a]).  

Surface Erosion 
Construction activities that disturb soil (i.e., pipeline, valve sites, and meter station construction) will likely 
result in some minor surface erosion of strippings until a stable vegetative cover can be established, 
particularly on slopes that are more susceptible to water erosion. Areas that will not be revegetated 
(i.e., meter station and associated access road) will be stabilized and gravelled over following construction 
activities to prevent erosion. The impact balance of this residual effect is considered negative since erosion 
could decrease soil productivity. NGTL’s minimal disturbance approach to pipeline construction is intended 
to reduce the areal extent of soil disturbance. The recommended erosion control measures to address this

issue are the industry accepted standards and, consequently, are expected to reduce loss of surface soils 
resulting from erosion to minor levels. This residual effect is reversible in the short to medium-term, since 
stable vegetation cover on the right-of-way or in the case of meter station construction, on the strippings 
storage piles, will likely establish within one year, however, may take longer in localized areas with 
moderately steep slopes. This residual effect is of low magnitude since it is considered to be well within 
environmental tolerances (Table 6.6, point [b]).  

Excessive Trench Subsidence or Remnant Crown 
Construction activities may result in localized areas of excessive trench subsidence and/or a remnant crown 
over the trench along the pipeline route. The impact balance of this residual effect is considered negative 
since excessive trench subsidence or remnant crowns may reduce soil productivity and affect local surface 
drainage. Proposed industry-accepted standard mitigation includes ensuring crowning over the trench line 
to ensure pipeline cover and reduce trench settlement. Reversibility is short to medium-term since remedial 
work associated with trench subsidence typically occurs within a year of construction, however, localized 
trench subsidence may arise up to three years following construction and the remnant crown is 
discontinuous to allow for normal surface drainage. It is anticipated that excessive trench subsidence would 
be identified during the PCM Program and appropriate mitigation measures taken. The magnitude is 
considered low since the residual effect is considered to be well within environmental tolerances (Table 6.6, 
point [c]). 

Strippings and Subsoil Mixing and Erosion during Operation and Maintenance  
A reduction in soil productivity may result when maintenance activities involving soil disturbance are 
required during operation of the pipeline (e.g., integrity digs). With the implementation of mitigation 
measures outlined in Table 6.5, this residual effect is reversible in the medium-term and of low magnitude 
(Table 6.6, point [d]).  

Combined Effects on Soils and Soil Productivity  
The combined effects for soils are those that may occur in combination during construction (items [a] 
through [c]). The combined effects on soil productivity of these potential residual effects occurring at one 
location would be not significant due to the overall low magnitude if all the effects were to occur at a 
particular location based in part on the limited areal extent where the effects would occur (i.e., Footprint). 
However, reversibility is considered to be medium-term since any combined effects on soil productivity are 
anticipated to take between 1 to 10 years to reverse (Table 6.6, point [e]). 

6.2.2.5 Summary 

Based on Table 6.6, there are no situations where there is a high probability of occurrence of a permanent 
or long-term residual environmental effect on soil and soil productivity of high magnitude that cannot be 
technically or economically mitigated. Consequently, the residual environmental effects of Project 
construction and operation on soil and soil productivity will be not significant. 

6.2.3 Water Quality and Quantity 

6.2.3.1 Spatial Boundaries 

The spatial boundaries used in the effects assessment of water quality and quantity considered one or 
more of the following areas: 

• a Footprint Study Area (as defined in Section 1.4);  

• a Water Quality and Quantity LSA; and 

• an Aquatics RSA. 

The Water Quality and Quantity LSA (Figure 6.2) is defined as a 1 km band centred on the proposed centre 
line (i.e., 500 m on both sides of the centre line) and 1 km around the meter station boundaries to 
incorporate effects that may extend beyond the Footprint (e.g., water erosion). At watercourses the LSA

matches the instream component of the Fish and Fish Habitat LSA. The ZOI at each watercourse was 
determined during desktop study based on the professional experience and judgement of the QAES by 
comparing waterbodies crossed by the proposed pipeline to the previously studied waterbodies of a similar 
size and class. The ZOI is typically the reach of a waterbody where 90% of the sediment load caused by 
construction activities is expected to fall out of suspension (AENV 2013a,b).  

The Aquatics RSA is defined as a 30 km wide band centred on the proposed pipeline route centre line 
(i.e., 15 km on both sides of the centre line). The Aquatics RSA is shown in Figure 6.2. 

6.2.3.2 Ecological Context 

The proposed route is located in the Peace River Basin in northwest Alberta with watercourse crossings in 
the Bald Mountain Creek sub-basin. All watercourse crossings along the proposed pipeline route are either 
first or second order tributaries in the Kakwa and Cutbank River sub-basins. In total, the pipeline route 
crosses 11 watercourses. Bald Mountain Creek (WC1 [KP 4.67] or the contingency method at WC1A 
[KP 4.67]), and 10 unnamed tributaries to Bald Mountain Creek (at KP 8.2 [WC3], KP 8.7 [WC4], KP 10.0 
[WC5], KP 12.0 [WC6], KP 14.3 [WC7], KP 16.1 [WC8], KP 16.2 [WC9], KP 21.9 [WC10], KP 22.9 [WC11] 
and KP 23.4 [WC12]) (Natural Resources Canada 2007-2011). The pipeline route also crosses 28 unnamed 
drainages that are all considered nonfish-bearing.  

There are no documented springs located along the proposed route (Alberta Energy Regulator/Alberta 
Geological Survey 2009), Aboriginal participants, however, reported the existence of potential natural 
springs at KP 14.3, discussed further in Appendix 8 (Table 2-2) TERA did not identify any defined springs 
at this location. There are 21 wells within approximately 500 m on both sides of the proposed pipeline route 
centre line, including 12 for industrial use, 6 for investigation, 1 domestic well, 1 listed as unknown and 
1 listed as other (AESRD 2014c).  

There are no known Watershed Management Plans for any of the watercourses crossed within the Aquatics 
RSA. There are no watercourses within 30 m of the proposed meter station site. There are seven industrial 
water wells located within 1.0 km of the meter station boundary (AESRD 2014c).

6.2.3.3 Potential Effects, Mitigation Measures and Potential Residual Effects 

The potential effects associated with the construction and operation of the pipeline on water quality and 
quantity were identified by the assessment team, and are listed in Table 6.7. TEK was gathered and 
recorded with community members from Aseniwuche Winewak Nation of Canada, Horse Lake First Nation, 
Sturgeon Lake Cree Nation, Nose Creek Settlement, Metis Nation Association Region 6, Kelly Lake Cree 
Nation and Kelly Lake Métis Settlement Society. Aboriginal community representatives shared TEK related 
to aquatics during field studies for the Project. Concerns that were identified by Aboriginal participants 
during biophysical field studies can be found in Table 2-2 of the TK Report (Appendix 8). Mitigation 
measures to reduce the severity of the potential effects of the proposed Project on water quality and quantity 
are provided in the EPP (Appendix 1). Key mitigation measures are summarized in Table 6.7. As noted, 
there are no watercourses located within 30 m of the proposed meter station location.  

Standard pipeline construction activities are designed to avoid circumstances that result in diversion and/or 
unnatural retention of water along the construction right-of-way by following recommendations from various 
industry, federal and provincial guidelines (AENV 1988, 1994, 1999, CAPP et al. 2012, Canadian Pipeline 
Environment Committee 2009, Fisheries and Oceans Canada [DFO] 2000, 2014) as well as in accordance 
with NGTL standards (Table 6.7).

6.2.3.4 Significance Evaluation of Potential Residual Effects 

A qualitative assessment was considered the most appropriate method to evaluate the significance of 
potential residual effects on water quality and quantity, due to the lack of quantitative data and accepted 
standards, guidelines and ecological thresholds. This qualitative assessment relied on available research 
literature and the professional judgement of the assessment team.  

Table 6.8 provides a summary of the significance evaluation of potential residual environmental effects of 
the construction and operation of the proposed pipeline on water quality and quantity. The rationale used 
to evaluate the significance of each of the residual environmental effects is provided below. An evaluation 
of significance was not required for those potential effects where no residual effect was identified 
(i.e., disruption of streamflow and alteration or contamination of aquatic environment as a result of 
withdrawal and release of hydrostatic test water).

residual effect of high magnitude that cannot be technically or economically mitigated. 

Localized Alteration of Natural Surface Water Flow Patterns  
With successful implementation of the proposed industry-accepted standard mitigation practices, disruption 
of surface flow patterns following construction is expected to be minor along the proposed pipeline route 
and the meter station. However, construction activities may contribute to some localized alteration of natural 
surface drainage patterns until trench settlement is complete along the proposed pipeline route and at 
excavated areas of the meter station. The impact balance of this potential residual effect is considered 
negative since it could decrease surface water quality and quantity. However, with proper implementation 
of the mitigation measures proposed, disruption of surface flow patterns following construction is likely to 
be minor along all segments of the route and at the meter station.  

In the event that construction or maintenance activities result in changes in surface water regimes, 
corrective action, in consultation with the appropriate authorities, will be conducted to resolve the issue. 
The PCM Program is expected to identify locations of altered drainage patterns (e.g., sunken trench, 
ponded water) and remedial work will be conducted. Although the residual effect of localized alteration of 
natural surface water flow patterns has a high probability, it is reversible in the short to long-term 
(i.e., short-term for the pipeline component and long-term for the meter station since the meter station will 
affect surface flow patterns for the duration of its service life), however, it is of low magnitude (Table 6.8, 
point [a]).

Reduction in Surface Water Quality Due to Suspended Solids during Instream Activities 
The selection of appropriate watercourse crossing techniques, designed to meet federal and provincial 
regulatory requirements, are likely to reduce the potential for adverse effects on surface water quality at 
watercourses encountered along the proposed pipeline route. Implementation of erosion controls on the 
approaches to watercourse crossings and protection and re-establishment of riparian revegetation will also 
aid in reducing the potential for adverse effects on surface water quality at watercourses encountered along 
the proposed pipeline route. During construction of isolated open cut crossings, or where an instream 
vehicle crossing is necessary, a minor and short-term sediment release is expected during installation and 
removal of the vehicle crossing or isolation structures. At dry or frozen to the bottom isolated open cut 
crossings, some mobilization of sediment may occur during spring freshet. The impact balance for this 
potential residual effect is considered to be negative since it could decrease surface water quality.  

Recent evidence demonstrates that smaller watercourses that lack substantial subsurface flow can be 
readily isolated with minimal sediment introduction when proper design, construction and mitigation 
measures are applied (CAPP et al. 2012, Reid et al. 2002). Consequently, it is anticipated that average 
total suspended solids (TSS) levels during instream construction at these sites will be below the CCME 
guidelines for short-term (24 hour) exposure of 25 mg/L above baseline levels (CCME 2007). Aquatic 
resources are protected by ensuring that concentration of TSS does not exceed CCME (2007) guidelines. 
A biologically important increase in TSS concentration above baseline is 25 mg/L, based on the Canadian 
guideline for short-term (24 hour) exposure (CCME 2007). AENV’s (1999) guideline of 10 mg/L TSS is 
based on chronic or long-term exposure to elevated suspended solids.  

DFO (2000) discusses levels of risk associated with increases in sediment concentration in watercourses 
and indicates increases of < 100 mg/L above background present low risk to fish and their habitat, while an 
increase of 100-200 mg/L presents a moderate risk, 200-400 mg/L presents a high risk and an excess of 
400 mg/L is an unacceptable risk, however, duration of exposure also needs to be taken into account 
(also see Birtwell 1999).  

Water quality monitoring will be conducted when activities occur that have the potential to cause events 
that may exceed the guidelines. Any exceedances of the relevant guidelines will be reported to the 
appropriate regulatory agencies. Minor releases of sediment may be associated with use of the temporary 
vehicle crossings at trenched crossing locations. Although elevated suspended sediment concentrations 
may result from instream construction and vehicle crossing use, pulses of suspended solids are generally 
expected to settle out of the water column within the ZOI in a timeframe measuring from minutes to a few 
hours (i.e., less than the short-term guideline of 24 hours). Therefore, the residual effect on water quality 
during the recommended trenched crossings are reversible in the immediate to short-term and of low 
magnitude (Table 6.8, point [b]).  

Reduction in Surface Water Quality Due to Erosion from Banks or Approach Slopes  
Following grading, it is likely that some erosion will occur on banks and approach slopes causing increased 
suspended sediment in surface water. The impact balance of this potential residual effect is considered 
negative since the erosion could decrease water quality. Although sedimentation due to erosion from banks 
and approach slopes is considered to have a high probability of occurrence, the proposed mitigation 
measures are expected to reduce the magnitude of erosion on surface water quality to low to medium 
levels, depending on the amount of erosion that occurs. This residual effect is reversible in the short to 
medium-term and of low to medium magnitude (Table 6.8, point [c]).  

Contamination of Surface Water Due to Spills Entering Waterbodies 
A spill entering a waterbody during construction could cause contamination of the surface water and would 
be considered to have a negative impact balance. Spill prevention measures outlined in Table 6.7 and the 
EPP will be followed. Depending on the volume and location (e.g., sensitivity of the receiving waterbody) 
of a spill, the magnitude could vary from low to high. Mitigation measures are in place to prevent spills from 
entering a waterbody (Table 6.7). This residual effect is reversible in the short to medium-term and is of low 
probability (Table 6.8, point [d]).

Reduction in Surface Water Quality Due to Accidental Release of Drilling Mud 
Although unlikely, it is possible for a drilling mud release to occur during HDD crossings that could cause a 
decrease in surface water quality due to an increase in suspended sediments. The impact balance of this 
potential residual effect is considered to be negative since the release could decrease water quality. An 
HDD crossing method is planned for the Bald Mountain Creek (WC1) crossing. 

The drilling mud and additives used for HDD crossings will be appropriate for use in the aquatic 
environment. Appropriate drill paths will be established and drilling mud pressures and returns will be 
monitored to reduce the risk of inadvertent releases of drilling mud during an HDD. Although sedimentation 
may occur, the proposed mitigation measures are expected to reduce the magnitude of a drilling mud 
release on surface water quality to low to medium levels, depending upon the amount of drilling mud 
released. This residual effect is reversible in the immediate to short-term and is of low probability (Table 6.8, 
point [e]). 

Reduction in Groundwater Quality Resulting from Spills  
High water tables may be encountered at some locations along the proposed pipeline route and at the 
meter station. The impact balance of a spill during construction or operation is considered to be negative 
since the spill could reduce groundwater quality. Depending on the volume and location, spills potentially 
affecting groundwater are considered to be of low to high magnitude and reversible in the short to long-term. 
With the implementation of spill prevention, clean-up and remediation measures, the probability of a spill 
entering the groundwater is considered low (Table 6.8, point [f]).  

Combined Effects on Surface Water Quality 
An evaluation of the combined effects considers those residual effects that are likely to occur and that may 
act in combination, therefore, residual effects [d], [e] and [f] in Table 6.8 are not considered in the evaluation 
of combined effects on water quality and quantity since the probability of the Project affecting surface or 
groundwater quality as a result of a spill or the accidental release of drilling mud is low. Consequently, the 
combined effects evaluation considers the individual potential residual effects evaluated that are likely to 
occur and could act in combination on water quality and quantity (points [b] and [c] of Table 6.8). Localized 
alteration of natural drainage patterns until trench settlement is complete (point [a] in Table 6.8) is of high 
probability but does not act in combination with residual effects [b] and [c] in Table 6.8, and is, therefore, 
not considered in the combined effects on water quality. 

The following potential residual effects may act in combination to result in overall effects on water quality: 

• reduction in surface water quality due to suspended solids during instream construction 
of trenched pipeline crossings or vehicle crossings; and 

• reduction in surface water quality due to erosion from banks or approach slopes. 

The adverse effects identified have the potential to act in combination on watercourses and drainages 
encountered by the proposed pipeline route. Reversibility of this combined residual effect is considered 
short to medium-term depending on the watercourse or drainage encountered and the probability of these 
residual effects acting in combination at any specific location along the proposed pipeline route. The 
magnitude of the combined effects on water quality is considered low to medium since the residual effect 
is within environmental or regulatory standards and the probability of two residual effects occurring at the 
same time is low (Table 6.8, point [g]).  

6.2.3.5 Summary 

As identified in Table 6.8, there are no situations with regard to water quality and quantity where there is a 
high probability of occurrence of a permanent or long-term residual effect of high magnitude that cannot be 
technically or economically mitigated. Consequently, it is concluded that the residual environmental effects 
of pipeline construction and operation on water quality or quantity will be not significant.

6.2.4 Air Emissions 

6.2.4.1 Spatial Boundaries 

The spatial boundaries used in the assessment of effects on air quality considered one or more of the 
following areas: 

• the Project Footprint (as defined in Section 1.4); and 

• an Air Emissions RSA.  

An Air Emissions RSA (Figure 6.3) was established to consider the area within which cumulative 
environmental effects on air quality are likely to occur. As such, the Air Emissions RSA encompasses the 
area where there is potential for environmental effects from the Project to interact with similar environmental 
effects from other projects or human activities. The spatial boundary of the Air Emissions RSA has been 
defined as a 5 km wide band centred on the proposed construction right-of-way (i.e., 2.5 km on both sides) 
and a 5 km radius centered on the meter station components. 

No Air Quality LSA was established for the Project since the effects from air emissions are regional in nature 
due to the transport and dispersion of pollutants away from the source.  

6.2.4.2 Environmental Context 

The land surrounding the proposed Project is remote with few human receptors for pollutants. In the Air 
Emissions RSA, activities contributing to CACs are primarily due to oil and gas activities (e.g., crude oil and 
natural gas production) (AENV 2008), with crude oil and natural gas production and processing activities 
being the major source of these emissions (Environment Canada 2014c). Construction-related CAC 
emissions will primarily result from fuel combustion of on-road and off-road vehicles and equipment, fugitive 
dust related to the use of off-road vehicles and equipment, and emissions associated with the burning of 
slash where salvage is not feasible. During operations, the Project will contribute to air quality during 
maintenance activities (i.e., vehicle or equipment use, aerial overflights and from running heaters in 
buildings).

6.2.4.4 Significance Evaluation of Potential Residual Effects 

A qualitative assessment was considered the most appropriate method to evaluate the significance of 
potential residual effects on air quality. This qualitative assessment relied on available research literature 
and the professional judgement of the assessment team.  

Table 6.10 provides a summary of the significance evaluation of potential residual environmental effects of 
the construction and operation of the Project (i.e., pipeline and meter station) on air emissions. The rationale 
used to evaluate the significance of each of the residual environmental effects is provided below. Refer to 
Section 6.2.16 for a discussion of nuisance emissions during construction and operation on human health.

a. Increased air 
emissions during 
construction and 
maintenance 
activities 

Impact balance: 
Negative 

• Construction and maintenance activities will result in 
decreased air quality.  

Spatial boundary: Air 
Emissions RSA 

• Potential increases in air emissions resulting from 
construction and maintenance activities will dissipate 
within the Air Emissions RSA. 

Duration: Short-Term • The events causing increases in air emissions are limited 
to the construction phase or during maintenance 
activities which are brief, focused and completed within 
any given year during the operations phase. 

Frequency: Isolated 
(during construction) to 
Periodic (during 
site-specific 
maintenance) 

• The event causing increases in air emissions 
(e.g., construction of the Project) is isolated during the 
construction phase. During operations, maintenance 
activities that involve air emissions, such as aerial 
patrols, and vehicle and equipment use, will occur 
intermittently, however, may occur repeatedly over the 
operations period (i.e., periodic). 

Reversibility: 
Short-Term 

• The effects are expected to reverse once construction or 
the maintenance activity is complete. 

Magnitude: Low • An increase in air emissions will occur and are 
anticipated to be within regulatory limits and will be low 
during maintenance. The periodic increases will be 
detectable, however, within normal variability of baseline 
conditions. 

Probability: High • The equipment and vehicles used for construction, 
maintenance activities and operation will produce air 
emissions. 

Confidence: Moderate • Dispersion modelling was not deemed necessary and 
the assessment is based on the experience of the 
assessment team. 

Significance: Not 
significant  

• The increase in air emissions as a result of Project 
activities is of low magnitude and is reversible in the 
short-term and, therefore, not significant.  

Note:  Significant Residual Environmental Effect: A high probability of occurrence of a permanent or long-term 
residual effect of high magnitude that cannot be technically or economically mitigated. 

 

Air Emissions during Construction and Maintenance Activities  
During construction and maintenance activities, increases in CAC emissions are anticipated. The primary 
source of CAC emissions during construction will be from any necessary slash burning associated with tree 
clearing where timber salvage is not feasible, as well as fuel combustion from vehicle and construction 
equipment and fugitive dust from on-road equipment use. The residual effect associated with fugitive dust 
is confined to construction and reclamation activities completed during nonfrozen conditions. During 
operations, maintenance activities will result in increases in CAC emissions from vehicle and equipment 
use, aerial patrols and the use of building heaters at the meter station. The amount of CAC emissions 
associated with construction and site-specific maintenance activities will be reduced by using 
well-maintained vehicles, reducing vehicle and equipment idling and using smoke control measures. These 
periodic increases in air emissions during construction or maintenance activities are anticipated to be within 
regulatory limits.

Although there is a high probability that the Project will contribute to air emissions during construction and 
maintenance, the residual effect of the Project’s contribution to CAC emissions are reversible in the 
short-term and of low magnitude (Table 6.10, point [a]).  

6.2.4.5 Summary 

As identified in Table 6.10, there are no situations with regard to air emissions where there is a high 
probability of occurrence of a permanent or long-term residual effect of high magnitude. Consequently, it is 
concluded that the residual environmental effect of the Project construction and operation on air emissions 
will be not significant. 

6.2.5 Greenhouse Gas Emissions 

6.2.5.1 Spatial Boundaries 

GHG emissions contribute to increases in mean global temperature by absorbing additional long-wave 
radiation in the atmosphere and re-emitting part of the radiation to the ground. Therefore, the spatial 
boundary for GHG emissions is international and encompasses all sources of GHG emissions from the 
Project and no GHG LSA or RSA has been defined for the Project. 

6.2.5.2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Context 

Construction-related GHG emissions primarily result from the exhaust emissions of on-road and off-road 
vehicles and equipment during construction, and emissions from any necessary slash burning during land 
clearing where timber salvage is not feasible. During the operations phase, sources of GHG emissions will 
be attributable to aerial overflights, fugitive emissions at the meter station, valve sites and along the pipeline 
and during planned blowdown events. Lesser emissions are also caused by equipment and vehicle used 
for vegetation management and other maintenance activities.  

6.2.5.3 Potential Effects, Mitigation Measures and Potential Residual Effects 

Potential effects associated with the construction and operation of the Project on GHG emissions were 
identified by the assessment team. A summary of these and additional measures included in Table 6.11 
were principally developed in accordance with industry guidelines, including Cheminfo Services Inc. (2005) 
and CAPP (1999), as well as NGTL standards.

6.2.5.4 Significance Evaluation of Potential Residual Effects 

A qualitative assessment was considered the most appropriate method to evaluate the significance of 
potential residual effects on GHG emissions. This qualitative assessment relied on available research 
literature and the professional judgement of the assessment team.  

Table 6.12 provides a summary of the significance evaluation of potential residual environmental effects of 
the construction and operation of the Project on GHG emissions. The rationale used to evaluate the 
significance of each of the residual environmental effects is provided below. Refer to Section 6.2.16 for a 
discussion of nuisance emissions during construction on human health.

a. Increase in GHG 
emissions during 
Project activities 

Impact Balance: 
Negative 

• The Project will contribute to increased GHG emissions. 

Spatial boundary: 
International 

• GHG emissions are global in nature. 

Duration: Short to 
Long-Term 

• The events causing emissions of GHG include construction 
and site-specific maintenance activities (i.e., short-term) 
and activities of over the 40 year operating period of the 
Project (i.e., long-term). 

Frequency: Isolated 
to Periodic 

• The events causing increases in GHG emissions 
(e.g., construction of the Project) is confined to a specific 
period and is periodic during operations. Maintenance and 
operations related activities (e.g., vegetation management, 
integrity digs, etc.) are isolated events that will occur 
intermittently, however, may occur repeatedly over the 
assessment period. 

Reversibility: 
Permanent 

• Due to the long atmospheric lifetime of GHG. 

Magnitude: Low  • There will be a detectable increase in GHG emissions, 
however, the increase does not contribute substantially to 
GHG emission totals and will be included in NGTL’s 
existing provincial and federal GHG reporting programs. 

Confidence: 
Moderate 

• Based on predicted GHG emissions for other projects of 
similar scope (i.e., pipeline and meter station construction) 
and the experience of the assessment team. 

Probability: High • The equipment and vehicles used for construction, 
site-specific maintenance activities and operation produce 
GHG emissions. 

Significance: Not 
Significant  

• The increase in GHG emissions during construction and 
site-specific maintenance is of low magnitude and, 
therefore, considered to be not significant.  

Note: 1 Significant Residual Environmental Effect: A high probability of occurrence of a permanent or long-term 
residual effect of high magnitude that cannot be technically or economically mitigated. 

Greenhouse Gas Emissions during Project Activities 
The primary source of GHG emissions during construction will be from off-road and on-road equipment use 
as well as land clearing and slash burning activities. Off-road equipment use as well as tree clearing and 
slash burning activities will account for the largest sources of GHG emissions during construction. During 
site specific maintenance, an increase in GHG emissions we be the result of periodic aircraft use during 
aerial patrol and vehicle and equipment use. The amount of GHG emissions associated with construction 
and site-specific maintenance activities as well as operation will be reduced by utilizing well-maintained 
equipment and reducing idling.

The potential for reduction in the effectiveness of carbon sinks and subsequent effect on GHG totals 
associated with clearing of vegetation will be reduced by following existing linear disturbances 
(approximately 78% of the proposed route), utilizing shared workspace, wherever practical, and maintaining 
environmentally responsible and economically efficient timber harvest operation in the Project Footprint 
(Appendix 1), thereby limiting the amount of clearing necessary. Based on the scope of the Project and 
duration of construction and maintenance activities, the GHG emissions associated with the Project are 
expected to be low and are unlikely to result in a measurable change to GHG emission totals. This residual 
effect of increased GHG emissions during construction and site-specific maintenance activities is of low 
magnitude (Table 6.12, point [a]).  

6.2.5.5 Summary 

As identified in Table 6.12, there are no situations where there is a high probability of occurrence of a 
permanent or long-term residual environmental effect on GHG emissions of high magnitude that cannot be 
technically or economically mitigated. Consequently, it is concluded that the residual environmental effect 
of Project construction and operation on GHG emissions will be not significant. 

6.2.6 Acoustic Environment 

6.2.6.1 Spatial Boundaries 

The spatial boundaries used in the assessment of effects on the acoustic environment included: 

• the Footprint (as defined in Section 1.4); and  

• an Acoustic Environment LSA. 

Based on the remoteness of the area except for one potential resident at the cabin located approximately 
550 m from the construction right-of-way, the Acoustic Environment LSA was established based on 
consideration of the area in which wildlife and land users (e.g., hunting, trapping, fishing and recreation) 
are most likely to be affected by Project-related noise during construction and operations (i.e., site-specific 
maintenance) of the Project. As such, the spatial boundary of the Acoustic Environment LSA has been 
defined to correlate with the Wildlife LSA for the Project, defined as a 2 km wide band centred on the 
proposed pipeline route (i.e., 1 km on both sides of the centre line) and a 1 km radius centered on the meter 
station (including valve site, access road and pipeline tie-in). The Acoustic Environment LSA is shown on 
Figure 6.4.  

No Acoustic Environment RSA was established for the Project since the effects from nuisance noise on 
wildlife and land users are not anticipated to extend beyond the Acoustic Environment LSA. 

6.2.6.2 Potential Effects, Mitigation Measures and Potential Residual Effects 

Potential effects associated with construction and operations of the Project on the acoustic environment 
were identified by the assessment team and are listed in Table 6.13. Given the Project components 
(Section 2.0), ambient noise levels in the LSA are not expected to increase during operation of the Project. 

A summary of measures recommended to mitigate the potential effects are also provided in Table 6.13. 
Many of these measures are considered industry standard, as provided by the Alberta Energy and 
Resources Conservation Board (2007) (currently regulated by the AER), and are in accordance with NGTL

6.2.6.3 Significance Evaluation of Potential Residual Effects 

Where there are no standards, guidelines, objectives or other established and accepted ecological 
thresholds to define quantitative rating criteria or where quantitative thresholds are not appropriate, the 
qualitative method is considered to be the appropriate method for determining the significance of the 
anticipated residual environmental effects. Consequently, a qualitative assessment of the acoustic 
environment was determined to be the most appropriate method for the evaluation of significance of each 
of the potential residual effects, relying on the professional judgement of the assessment team. 

Table 6.14 provides a summary of the significance evaluation of potential residual environmental effects of 
the construction and maintenance of the Project on the acoustic environment. The rationale used to 
evaluate the significance of each of the residual environmental effects is provided below.

SIGNIFICANCE - ACOUSTIC ENVIRONMENT 

Potential 
Residual Effect Criteria Rating Effects Characterization Rationale 

a. Increase in 
nuisance noise 
during construction 
and site-specific 
maintenance 
activities  

Impact Balance: Negative • Noise arising from construction activities will occur 
along the pipeline route and at the meter station. 

Spatial boundary: 
Acoustic Environment LSA 

• Noise resulting from construction and maintenance 
activities may transmit beyond the construction 
right-of-way. 

Duration: Immediate to 
Short-Term 

• The event causing nuisance noise is construction of 
the Project. Certain maintenance activities may take 
less than 2 days (e.g., aerial patrol) while others may 
take longer however, less than 1 year to complete 
(e.g., integrity dig). 

Frequency: Isolated or 
Periodic 

• The event causing nuisance noise (e.g., construction 
of the Project) is confined to a specific, isolated 
period. The event causing nuisance noise 
(i.e., maintenance activities) occurs periodically, 
however, may occur repeatedly over the assessment 
period.

TABLE 6.14  Cont’d 

Potential 
Residual Effect Criteria Rating Effects Characterization Rationale 

a. Increase in 
nuisance noise 
during construction 
and site-specific 
maintenance 
activities (cont’d) 

Reversibility: Immediate 
to Short-Term 

• The effects associated with nuisance noise will be 
alleviated when construction is completed. Certain 
maintenance activities may take less than 2 days and 
will have immediate reversibility (e.g., aerial patrol) 
while others may take longer, however, less than 1 
year to complete (e.g., integrity dig). 

Magnitude: Low • The magnitude is considered low, given the remote 
location and lack of permanent receptors. 

Probability: High • Certain equipment (e.g., heavy machinery), which may 
be used during site-specific maintenance activities, will 
produce noise over baseline conditions while in use. 

Confidence: High • Based on the experience of the assessment team. 
Significance: Not 
Significant 

• The increase of nuisance noise during Project 
activities is of low magnitude and reversible in the 
immediate to short-term and, therefore, considered to 
be not significant.  

Note: Significant Residual Environmental Effect: A high probability of occurrence of a permanent or long-term 
residual effect of high magnitude that cannot be technically or economically mitigated. 

 

Nuisance Noise during Construction and Site-Specific Maintenance Activities 
Noise arising from construction and site-specific maintenance activities will occur periodically along the 
entire proposed pipeline route and at the meter station, and is considered to have a negative impact 
balance. However, the residual effects of an increase in nuisance noise will be limited to areas in proximity 
to human receptors (e.g., land users). The linear progression of pipeline construction results in an 
approximately one month duration of concentrated construction activity at any given location. Construction 
activities at the meter station are anticipated to take approximately three weeks to complete. Equipment 
and vehicles will be equipped with noise abatement equipment (e.g., mufflers). Noise associated with 
general maintenance activities will occur periodically over the life of the Project. The residual effect of 
construction noise on land users (e.g., hunters, trappers) is of low magnitude and reversible in the 
immediate to short-term depending on the duration of the activity (Table 6.14, point [a]). The effect of 
construction noise on wildlife is discussed in Section 6.2.10 and the effect of noise during operation on 
human health is discussed in Section 6.2.16.  

6.2.6.4 Summary 

As identified in Table 6.14, there are no situations where there is a high probability of occurrence of a 
permanent or long-term residual environmental effect on the acoustic environment of high magnitude that 
cannot be technically or economically mitigated. Consequently, it is concluded that the residual 
environmental effects of Project construction on the acoustic environment will be not significant. 

6.2.7 Fish and Fish Habitat 

6.2.7.1 Spatial Boundaries 

The spatial boundaries used in the effects assessment of fish and fish habitat considered one or more of 
the following areas: 

• a Footprint Study Area (as defined in Section 1.4); 

• a Fish and Fish Habitat LSA; and 

• an Aquatics RSA.

The Fish and Fish Habitat LSA (Figure 6.5) is defined as 200 m upstream and a minimum of 300 m 
downstream of the pipeline construction right-of-way at all watercourses and drainages crossed by the 
proposed pipeline route. A downstream limit of 400 m, based on the ZOI, was used at WC1 and 300 m at 
all remaining watercourse crossings (i.e., WC2 to WC12). There are many variables (e.g., stream velocity, 
discharge rate, turbidity levels) to consider when evaluating distances downstream at which impacts of the 
Project may affect specific fish populations. The ZOI at each watercourse was determined during the 
desktop study based on the professional experience and judgement of the QAES by comparing 
watercourses and drainages crossed by the proposed pipeline to previously studied waterbodies of a similar 
size and class. The ZOI is typically the reach of a watercourse or drainage where 90% of the sediment load 
caused by construction activities is expected to fall out of suspension (AESRD 2013a,b). Dry or frozen to 
bottom conditions during winter will limit the potential for downstream impacts at most crossings. The Fish 
and Fish Habitat LSA also includes the area of riparian vegetation to a width of 30 m back from each bank 
edge within the width of the construction right-of-way. For illustrative purposes only, the Fish and Fish 
Habitat LSA is shown as a 1 km band centered on the proposed pipeline centre line. As previously noted, 
there are no watercourses within 30 m of the meter station components (i.e., access road and valve site 
tie-in) and that component is not considered further in this section.  

The Aquatics RSA is defined as a 30 km wide band centred on the proposed pipeline route centre line 
(i.e., 15 km on both sides of the centre line). The Aquatics RSA is shown in Figure 6.2. 

The spatial boundaries associated with the Aquatics RSA used for the effects assessment for Fish and Fish 
Habitat are described in Section 6.2.3 Water Quality and Quantity. 

6.2.7.2 Ecological Context 

The proposed route is located in the Bald Mountain Creek sub-basin, which is part of the Peace River 
Basin. Bald Mountain Creek is a direct tributary to the Wapiti River, which in turn flows into the Smoky River, 
a major tributary to the Peace River. Bald Mountain Creek originates from several small tributaries at 
approximately 1,000 m above sea level in west central Alberta. It flows northeasterly for approximately 
70 km to its confluence with Big Mountain Creek, which occurs at an elevation of approximately 655 m 
above sea level. Major tributaries within this reach include Wilson and Campbell creeks. After joining Big 
Mountain Creek, flow continues north for approximately 30 km before entering the Wapiti River. 

Open water aquatic assessments conducted in May 2014 along the proposed pipeline route identified 
11 watercourses and 28 nonfish-bearing drainages (Appendix 3). The 11 watercourses crossed by the 
proposed pipeline route include Bald Mountain Creek (WC1 [KP 4.6] or the contingency method at WC1A 
[KP 4.67]) as well as 10 unnamed tributaries to Bald Mountain Creek located at KP 8.2 (WC3), KP 8.7 
(WC4), KP 10.0 (WC5), KP 12.0 (WC6), KP 14.3 (WC7), KP 16.1 (WC8), KP 16.2 (WC9), KP 21.9 (WC10), 
KP 22.9 (WC11) and KP 23.4 (WC12) (Natural Resources Canada 2007-2011).  

The expected fish community in the Bald Mountain Creek sub-basin is a mix of both coldwater 
(e.g., salmonids) and cool water (e.g., percids and esocids) species, according to Nelson and Paetz (1992). 
Fish species occurring within the mainstem of Bald Mountain Creek or within 2 km upstream from the mouth 
of any of its tributaries occurring in the area of the Project include: Arctic grayling; white sucker; longnose 
sucker; brook stickleback; lake chub; pearl dace; trout-perch; fathead minnow; longnose dace; northern 
redbelly dace; finescale dace; redside shiner; and emerald shiner.  

Bull trout are listed by COSEWIC as Special Concern (COSEWIC 2014a). However, they are not known to 
occur within the LSA of the proposed watercourse crossings. Spoonhead sculpin are listed as Not at Risk 
by COSEWIC (COSEWIC 2014a), however, they are listed on the COSEWIC candidate list as low-priority 
for a detailed status assessment (COSEWIC 2014a, b) and are listed provincially as May be at Risk 
(ASRD 2011). Arctic grayling are high-priority candidates for a detailed status assessment, while slimy 
sculpin are mid-priority candidates for a detailed assessment by COSEWIC (2014b). Provincially, bull trout 
and Arctic grayling are listed under the general status as Sensitive by ASRD (2011). In addition, Alberta’s 
ESCC has further listed these two species with a detailed status of Species of Special Concern (Arctic 
grayling) and Threatened (bull trout) (AESRD 2014b). These species (i.e., bull trout, spoonhead sculpin, 
Arctic grayling) are not expected to occur in any of the watercourses crossed by the proposed pipeline, but

are found in or near the watershed. Additional information concerning fish and fish habitat at watercourses 
crossed by the proposed route is provided in the Aquatic Assessment (Appendix 3).  

Fish and fish habitat sensitivity for all species is generally highest during spawning and emergence, and 
when they may be stressed by habitat conditions (e.g., during winter when suitable habitat may be limited, 
or in summer when water temperatures or dissolved oxygen levels approach critical thresholds). The habitat 
conditions documented at the watercourse crossings along the pipeline route indicate that potential for 
critical habitats (i.e., spawning habitat for fall spawning species and overwintering habitat) to occur in the 
stream reaches that have the greatest potential to be negatively affected by construction activities (i.e., the 
ZOI during construction activities) is low. As a result, with the successful implementation of the 
recommended mitigation measures, the potential for the Project to negatively affect sensitive species or 
sensitive fish habitat is also considered low.
