6.2.7.3 Potential Effects, Mitigation Measures and Potential Residual Effects 

Potential effects on fish and fish habitat associated with the construction and operation of the pipeline were 
identified by Aseniwuche Winewak Nation of Canada, Horse Lake First Nation, Sturgeon Lake Cree Nation, 
Nose Creek Settlement, Métis Nation Association Region 6, Kelly Lake Cree Nation and Kelly Lake Métis 
Settlement Society as well as the assessment team during the aquatics field studies for this Project. 
Aboriginal community representatives shared TEK related to aquatics during field studies for the Project. 
Concerns that were identified by Aboriginal participants during biophysical field studies can be found in 
Table 2-2 of the TK Report (Appendix 8). Mitigation measures recommended in the Aquatic Assessment 
(Appendix 3) to reduce the severity of potential effects of the Project on fish and fish habitat have been 
incorporated into Table 6.15. These measures were developed in accordance with several industry as well 
as provincial and federal regulatory guidelines, including CAPP et al. (2012), DFO (1995) and 
AENV (2013 a,b).

LSA General 
• Watercourse crossing requirements 

are provided in Table 2 and in 
Section 8.4 of the EPP, and are 
indicated on the Environmental 
Alignment Sheets [Section 7.1]. 

Clearing and Grading 
• Prohibit clearing of extra temporary 

workspace within 10 m of a 
watercourse to protect riparian areas. 
This area shall be clearly marked prior 
to clearing operations. The 
right-of-way will be narrowed through 
the riparian area, if possible 
[Section 8.4]. 

• Fell trees away from watercourses. 
Immediately remove trees, debris or 
soil inadvertently deposited below the 
high watermark of a watercourse 
[Section 8.4].  

• If the working surface is unstable, do 
not permit clearing equipment within 
the 10 m riparian buffer, unless 
approved by the Environmental 
Inspector(s). Following clearing, the 
10 m riparian buffer will remain intact 
(i.e., consisting of low-lying understory 
vegetation) [Section 8.4]. 

• Delay grading of the primary banks of 
watercourses until immediately before 
construction of the crossing. If 
required, appropriate temporary 
erosion and sediment control 
structures shall be installed, at the 
discretion of the Environmental 
Inspector(s), upon initial disturbance 
of the vegetative mat and strippings 
[Section 8.4]. 

• Alteration or 
loss of riparian 
habitat function

Effect(s) 
3. Alteration or loss 

of instream 
habitat (cont’d) 

See above See above • Remove all temporary vehicle crossing 
structures prior to spring break-up. 
Remove or breach snow or ice bridges 
to ensure they do not impede flow. 
Ensure that removal of access does 
not disturb the bed or banks of the 
crossing [Section 8.8]. 

• Construct all bridges (ice and snowfill 
bridges or single-span bridges) 
beyond the ends of the banks and 
with a minimum depth of 0.5 m of 
snowfill or fill material at each bank. 
Do not place fill within primary banks 
for bridge abutment construction, 
unless approved by the appropriate 
regulatory agency [Section 8.4]. 

Trenched Crossings 
• Conduct typical open cut of seasonally 

dry or frozen to the bottom 
watercourses in accordance with 
DFO’s Measures to Avoid Causing 
Harm to Fish and Fish Habitat and 
best practices as described in the 
former Isolated or Dry Open-cut 
Stream Crossings Operational 
Statement [Section 8.4]. 

• Store excavation material outside the 
watercourse during the open cut 
[Section 8.4]. 

• Place only imported, clean, coarse 
material (gravel or rock) or native 
material removed from the trench as 
the final 0.5 m of backfill. Any imported 
material must be obtained from an 
NGTL-approved off-site location 
[Section 8.4]. 

Isolated Open Cut Crossings  
• Before the installation of the water 

crossing and the commencement of 
instream activity, the Contractor will 
ensure that all necessary equipment 
and materials are available and are 
on-site [Section 8.4].

See above 

4. Increased 
suspended 
sediment 
concentrations in 
the water column 

Pipeline - 
watercourse 
crossings 

LSA General 
• Seed disturbed banks and riparian 

areas with an approved native seed 
mixture. The Environmental 
Inspector(s) will determine on-site 
whether other restoration methods 
need to be applied to stabilize banks 
(e.g., soil wraps, brush layers and 
matting) [Section 8.4]. 

• Develop water quality monitoring 
plans to monitor for sediment events 
during instream construction activities 
as required by the applicable 
regulatory approvals (i.e., DFO’s 
Measures to Avoid Causing Harm to 
Fish and Fish Habitat). If monitoring 
reveals sediment values are 
approaching threshold values, the 
water quality monitors will alert the 
Environmental Inspector(s) and work 
with them to develop corrective 
actions. If corrective actions are not 
successful, construction activities will 
be temporarily suspended until 
effective solutions are identified 
[Section 8.4]. 

• If spoil is likely to be highly saturated, 
excavate a pit or construct berms of 
packed earth to prevent spoil from 
flowing back into the watercourse. 
Locate containment berms and spoil 
outside of the 10 m riparian area 
(Dwg. STDS-03-ML-05-131) 
[Section 8.4]. 

• Postpone watercourse crossing 
construction if excessive flows or flood 
conditions exist or are anticipated, and 
construction methods cannot be 
modified to cope with the increased 
flow, follow the Flood and Excessive 
Flow Contingency Plan (Appendix 1E 
of the EPP) [Section 8.4]. 

• Increase in 
suspended 
solids during 
instream 
construction at 
trenched 
crossings within 
the ZOI and 
temporary 
vehicle 
crossings

there is potential for runoff from the 
right-of-way to flow into a 
watercourse, refer to the Soil Erosion 
Contingency Plan (Appendix 1E of the 
EPP) [Section 8.4]. 

Trenchless Crossings 
• Ensure that water from dewatering 

entry and exit sites with a high 
sediment load is not discharged or 
allowed to flow into any waterbody. 
Remove the sediment load (e.g., 
filtered or discharged into a vegetated 
area) before discharge water is 
allowed to enter any watercourse 
[Section 8.4].  

Isolated Open Cut Crossings 
• Ensure water from flumes, dam and 

pumps, diversion or other methods do 
not cause erosion or introduce 
sediment into the channel 
[Section 8.4]. 

• Dewater the trench onto stable 
surfaces in a manner that does not 
cause erosion of soils or 
sedimentation of the watercourse 
[Section 8.4].

RSA General 
• If an isolated method is employed, 

and where recommended by an 
aquatics specialist (i.e., QAES or 
provincial equivalent), conduct a fish 
salvage led by an aquatics specialist 
[Section 8.4]. 

• A Fish Research License from 
AESRD is required for fish salvage 
activities and must be applied for at 
least 10 working days in advance so it 
is received prior to isolation of the 
watercourse [Section 8.4].  

• Conduct fish salvage, in accordance 
with permit conditions, using 
appropriate methods and equipment. 
Release all captured fish to areas 
downstream of the crossing that 
provide suitable habitat [Section 8.4]. 

• Screen all water intakes in 
accordance with the Freshwater 
Intake End-of-Pipe Fish Screen 
Guideline published by DFO. Maintain 
screens so they are clear of debris 
[Section 8.7].

• Install and remove any temporary 
vehicle crossings in a manner that 
protects the banks from erosion and 
maintains the flow in the waterway. 
These crossings will be returned to 
their pre-construction condition 
[Section 8.4]. 

• Remove all temporary vehicle 
crossing structures prior to spring 
break-up. Remove or breach snow or 
ice bridges to ensure they do not 
impede flow. Ensure that removal of 
access does not disturb the bed or

6.2.7.4 Significance Evaluation of Potential Residual Effects 

A qualitative assessment was considered the most appropriate method to evaluate the significance of 
potential residual effects on fish and fish habitat, with the evaluation of significance of each of the potential 
residual effects relying on federal and provincial guidelines, available research literature and the 
professional judgement of the assessment team. 

Table 6.16 provides a summary of the significance evaluation of potential residual environmental effects of 
the construction and operation of the proposed pipeline on fish and fish habitat. The rationale used to 
evaluate the significance of each of the residual environmental effects is provided below. An evaluation of 
significance is not required for those potential effects where no residual effect is identified (i.e., interbasin 
transfer of aquatic organisms).

Alteration or Loss of Riparian Habitat 
Riparian vegetation within the proposed right-of-way and temporary workspace will be disturbed to some 
degree at all watercourse crossings with the likely exception of Bald Mountain Creek (WC1), where the 
preferred pipeline crossing method is a trenchless HDD crossing method. The contingency pipeline 
crossing method at Bald Mountain Creek is an isolated open cut pipeline crossing method and if 
implemented will also result in riparian disturbance at that location. During construction, disturbance to 
riparian vegetation will be minimized, leaving as much existing vegetation intact as practical, and efforts to 
control erosion and sedimentation in disturbed areas will be implemented. Disturbance to riparian 
vegetation will also be minimized during frozen ground conditions. Disturbed riparian areas will be seeded 
post-construction, as necessary, with the appropriate native seed mix formulated with species that 
germinate and establish quickly. This will help stabilize the surface organic layer as well as minimize 
competition for naturally generating plant species. Monitoring for vegetation establishment will commence 
the first full growing season following construction, and reseeding and the implementation of additional

erosion controls will be added as necessary. Although the probability for alteration or loss of riparian habitat 
is considered high, the residual effect of pipeline construction on clearing riparian vegetation is considered 
to be reversible in the medium to long-term and of low magnitude, depending on the pre-existing vegetation 
community (e.g., shrubs regenerate within several years, however, tree canopy regrowth is expected to 
extend into the long-term) (Table 6.16, point [a]).  

Routine vegetation control along the proposed right-of-way during operations (e.g., site-specific 
maintenance) will exclude riparian areas. However, a situation may occur during the life of the pipeline 
where riparian vegetation disturbance may be necessary to accommodate maintenance activities (e.g., in 
the event of a flood event that causes scouring over the pipeline trench that would require measures to 
restore depth of cover and pipe integrity). The residual effect of clearing riparian vegetation during pipeline 
maintenance operation has a low probability, is of low magnitude and is reversible in the medium to 
long-term (Table 6.16, point [b]).  

Alteration of Instream Habitat  
NGTL is proposing to use trenched isolated or dry open-cut crossing techniques for all watercourse 
crossings, with the exception of the crossing at Bald Mountain Creek (WC1) (Table 5 of the Aquatic 
Assessment [Appendix 3]). The preferred pipeline crossing method at Bald Mountain Creek is a trenchless 
HDD method and the contingency pipeline crossing method is an isolated open cut method. The 
contingency pipeline method will be implemented only if the preferred trenchless pipeline crossing method 
is unsuccessful or not feasible. The contingency crossing location (WC1-A) (Table 5 of the Aquatic 
Assessment [Appendix 3]) on Bald Mountain Creek is at the same location as the preferred crossing 
location. NGTL has taken into consideration the sensitivity of the watercourses, including habitat 
characteristics, fish species present and RAPs for each watercourse crossing. Isolated open-cut methods 
are recommended for these crossings if water is present at the time of construction, while dry open cut 
methods are recommended for the crossings that are dry or frozen to the bottom at the time of construction. 
NGTL will also implement technical and economically feasible mitigation measures at each crossing. 
Introduction of fine sediment to watercourses from instream activities and sediment generated by runoff 
from the construction right-of-way can have sublethal (e.g., irritation of gill tissue) and lethal 
(e.g., suffocation of developing embryos) effects on fish. Fine sediments also cause downstream sediment 
deposition that alters substrate composition as well as modifies the availability and suitability of habitat for 
spawning, overwintering and rearing (Anderson et al. 1996, Newcombe and MacDonald 1991). Effects 
associated with fine sediments in the water column are addressed in the following subsection. 

The proposed watercourse crossing methods for the potential watercourse crossings, except WC1, and the 
unnamed drainages, are included under the Dewatering/Pumping and Bridges, Causeways and Culverts 
activities of the DFO Self-Assessment Process. Watercourse crossings, temporary vehicle crossings and 
dewatering/pumping associated with the proposed crossings are generally considered low risk activities 
which do not require regulatory review when implemented with mitigation as described by the Measures to 
Avoid Causing Harm to Fish and Fish Habitat (DFO 2013) and the EPP (Appendix 1) as summarized in 
Table 6.15. However, material changes to proposed crossing methods or timing that are likely to result in 
adverse effects to fish and fish habitat would be subject to a risk-based re-evaluation by a QAES. The 
construction of the proposed watercourse crossings are planned to occur within the RAP on the 11 Class C 
watercourses. Construction can occur at any time and does not require QAES recommendations for 
Class C watercourses if a trenchless crossing method is used (WC1) or the watercourse is dry and/or frozen 
to the bottom at the time of construction (AENV 2013a). However, recommendations from a QAES are 
required for construction at Class C watercourses if construction occurs during the RAP, if water is present 
at time of construction (AENV 2013a). The QAES that assessed the Project has determined that if the 
mitigation measures as per Table 6.15 and the EPP (Appendix 1) are implemented, and since fish species 
of management concern are not known to occur within the ZOI, serious harm to fish and fish habitat will 
likely not occur.  

Although there is a high probability of alteration of instream habitat during construction, the potential 
residual effects are expected to be of low magnitude and reversible in the short-term (Table 6.16, point [c]).

Increased Suspended Solids and Sediment Deposition  
An evaluation of increased suspended solids concentrations and sediment deposition during instream 
construction is provided in Section 6.2.3 Water Quality and Quantity. Through the selection of appropriate 
watercourse crossing techniques, vehicle crossing methods and the successful implementation of erosion 
controls on approaches to watercourse crossings and riparian area revegetation as outlined in Table 6.15, 
the potential for adverse effects on aquatic systems along the proposed pipeline route due to suspended 
solids in the water column and sediment deposition is reduced. 

Turbidity levels and suspended sediment concentrations will be monitored, where warranted, during 
instream activities at isolated crossings with habitat potential for sportfish and/or listed fish species to 
confirm that TSS levels remain below the CCME standard of 25 mg/L above baseline (CCME 2002). This 
is the level, based on 24 hours of exposure, when mortalities of the most sensitive life history stage begin 
to occur (Newcombe 1994). DFO (2000) discusses levels of risk associated with increases in sediment 
concentration in watercourses and indicates increases of < 100 mg/L above background present low risk 
to fish and their habitat, while an increase of 100-200 mg/L presents a moderate risk, 200-400 mg/L 
presents a high risk and an excess of 400 mg/L is an unacceptable risk, however, duration of exposure also 
needs to be taken into account (Birtwell 1999). AENV’s (1999) guideline of 10 mg/L TSS is based on chronic 
or long-term exposure to elevated suspended solids. 

Although the probability of occurrence is high, monitoring of suspended sediment concentrations will be 
conducted and mitigation will be applied to reduce the extent and effect of increased suspended solids. 
With the successful implementation of the recommended mitigation measures, the residual effect of 
increased suspended solids concentrations on fish and fish habitat is considered reversible in the 
immediate to short-term and of low magnitude, depending on the extent and duration of sediment release 
(Table 6.16, point [d]).  

Fish Mortality or Injury  
Suspended sediment released at watercourse crossings with fish habitat potential during instream activities 
could cause behavioural (i.e., avoidance and alarm reaction) or sublethal/lethal effects (i.e., irritation of gill 
tissue or suffocation of developing embryos) on fish within the ZOI (Anderson et al. 1996, Newcombe and 
MacDonald 1991). As indicated above, turbidity levels and suspended sediment concentrations will be 
monitored, where warranted, at these crossings to confirm that levels remain below the CCME standard of 
25 mg/L above baseline (CCME 2002). This is the lower level at which mortality of the most sensitive life 
history stage has been reported (Newcombe 1994).  

Trenched crossings (i.e., isolated or dry open-cut) are planned for all watercourse crossings (with the 
exception of WC 1) along the proposed pipeline route. Fish salvage operations, under the direction of a 
QAES, will be conducted during isolated crossings at WC1 and WC9, and at watercourse crossings where 
water and fish are present at the time of construction. Fish will be captured prior to dewatering and removed 
to suitable habitat downstream of the crossing location. With the successful implementation of the 
recommended mitigation measures, the residual effect of fish mortality or injury is considered to be of low 
probability, low magnitude and reversible in the short-term (Table 6.16, point [e]). 

Blockage of Fish Movements  
The industry-accepted mitigation measures outlined in Table 6.15 and the EPP will reduce the potential for 
blockage of fish movements by instream construction and temporary vehicle access. 

Temporary blockage of fish movements during construction of isolated trenched watercourse crossings will 
be immediately removed upon the completion of construction of a given watercourse crossing. The 
construction of the proposed watercourse crossings is planned to occur within the RAP on the 11 Class C 
watercourses, however, with the successful implementation of the mitigation measures in Table 6.15 and 
the EPP (Appendix 1). Additionally, as migration of fish species known to occur in the Project area is unlikely 
to occur during construction, and fish species of management concern are not known to occur within the 
ZOI, blockage of fish movement is unlikely to occur. No new permanent vehicle crossings are associated 
with the proposed pipeline construction, and, therefore, the proposed pipeline is not expected to contribute 
to habitat fragmentation for fish communities within the Aquatics RSA. The residual effect of the

construction of the pipeline on blockage of fish movements is considered to be reversible in the immediate 
to short-term, of low probability and of low magnitude (Table 6.16, point [f]).  

Contamination of Instream and Riparian Habitat from Spills during Construction 
If a large spill, such as a fuel truck rollover in a stream were to occur, the adverse effects could, depending 
upon the size of the spill, be of high magnitude with potentially long-lasting effects to the health of the 
watercourse. If a large spill were to occur in a riparian area, in addition to the direct effects on riparian 
vegetation, clean-up and reclamation measures would likely result in additional riparian habitat disturbance. 
The potential residual effects of a spill may be of low to high magnitude, depending upon the volume of the 
spill and the sensitivity of the receiving environment. Although spill contingency and clean-up measures 
would reduce the magnitude and shorten the reversibility of the residual effects, such an incident could be 
considered of high magnitude if it were to occur in a highly sensitive environment. 

The residual effect of a spill on instream and riparian habitat is reversible in the short to medium- term and 
may be of low to high magnitude. Since large spills rarely occur within the construction right-of-way during 
construction and maintenance activities, and occur even more rarely in riparian or instream habitat, the 
probability of such an event is low (Table 6.16, point [g]). 

Potential Effects as a Result of Accidental Drilling Mud Release  
During HDD crossings (i.e., Bald Mountain Creek crossing), monitoring of drilling fluid volumes and 
pressure as well as monitoring of sediment concentrations in the watercourse and monitoring for on-land 
frac-outs are expected to reduce the potential for a drilling mud release to affect a watercourse. If a release 
on-land (i.e., terrestrial) were to occur, the inert nature of the bentonite clay used would not contaminate 
the riparian area. However, clean-up and reclamation measures are likely to result in some riparian habitat 
disturbance. Implementation of mitigation and reclamation measures as well as efforts to contain a 
terrestrial release will reduce the potential for the release to affect aquatic habitat. The residual effect of a 
drilling mud release on riparian habitat is of low probability, low to medium in magnitude (depending on the 
size of the release and area affected) and reversible in the short to medium-term (also see Section 6.2.20 
Accidents and Malfunctions) (Table 6.16, point [h]). 

A release of drilling mud into a watercourse could affect instream habitat by increasing suspended 
sediments and sediment deposition. Increased sediment in the water column can increase the probability 
of fish mortality, however, with the implementation of the Directional Drilling Procedures and Instream 
Drilling Mud Release Contingency Plan (Appendix 1E of the EPP), the residual effect of a drilling mud 
release on instream habitat and fish mortality or injury are considered to be of low to high magnitude, but 
of low probability (Table 6.16, point [i]). The residual effect of a drilling mud release on instream habitat and 
fish mortality or injury is reversible in the immediate to medium-term, depending on the volume of the 
release and flow rates of the watercourse and, consequently, is not significant (Table 6.16, point [i]).  

Combined Effects on Fish and Fish Habitat  
An evaluation of the combined effects considers those residual effects that are likely to occur and, therefore, 
residual effects [b], [e], [f], and [g] in Table 6.16 are not considered in the evaluation of combined effects 
on fish and fish habitat since the probability of these effects occurring is low. Consequently, the combined 
effects evaluation considers the individual potential residual effects evaluated in Section 6.2.7.5 (points [a], 
[c] and [d] of Table 6.16) that are likely to occur, and could act in combination on fish and fish habitat. 

The following potential residual effects are likely to act in combination to result in overall effects on fish and 
fish habitat during a trenched crossing: 

• clearing or disturbance of riparian vegetation within the construction right-of-way and 
temporary workspace during construction;  

• alteration of instream habitat within the ZOI at trenched crossings and temporary vehicle 
crossings; and 

• increase in suspended solids during instream construction at trenched crossings within 
the ZOI.

Trenched isolated or dry open cut crossings are planned for all watercourses with the exception of Bald 
Mountain Creek (WC1) and can be constructed under the DFO Self-Assessment Process. The construction 
of the proposed watercourse crossings are planned to occur within the RAP on the 11 Class C 
watercourses. Construction can occur at any time and does not require QAES recommendations for Class 
C watercourses if a trenchless crossing method is used or the watercourse is dry and/or frozen to the 
bottom at the time of construction (AENV 2013a). However, if construction is to occur at a Class C 
watercourse during the RAP and water is present at the time of construction, recommendations from a 
QAES are required (AENV 2013a). Since construction will occur during winter conditions, nine of the 
watercourse crossings (WC3 to WC8, WC10 to WC12) will likely be dry or frozen to the bottom, therefore, 
fish will likely not be present at the time of construction, and no serious harm to fish will occur. For the 
remaining isolated, open cut crossing (WC9), if water is present, a fish salvage will be conducted, and no 
serious harm to fish will occur. All drainages crossed by the Project are nonfish-bearing, therefore, no 
effects on fish or fish habitat are expected. For crossings on fish-bearing watercourses, even though there 
is a high probability for the combined residual effects discussed above to occur at crossings, with the 
mitigation measures that are proposed, the potential for combined residual effects at these crossings is of 
low magnitude and reversible in the medium to long-term (Table 6.16, point [j]).  

6.2.7.5 Summary 

Mitigation measures have been designed to avoid and reduce the severity of the potential effects of pipeline 
construction and operation on fish and fish habitat. As identified in Table 6.16, there are no situations with 
regard to fish and fish habitat where there is a high probability of occurrence of a permanent or long-term 
residual environmental effect of high magnitude that cannot be technically or economically mitigated. 
Consequently, it is concluded that the residual environmental effects of pipeline construction and operation 
on fish and fish habitat will be not significant. 

6.2.8 Wetlands 

6.2.8.1 Spatial Boundaries 

The spatial boundaries considered for the effects assessment on wetlands considered one or more of the 
following areas: 

• a Footprint Study Area (as defined in Section 1.4); 

• a Wetland LSA; and 

• a Wetland RSA.  

Wetland surveys within the Footprint provide information on pre-construction wetland function for wetlands 
temporarily and directly affected during the construction and operation phases of the Project (i.e., wetlands 
crossed by the proposed pipeline route). 

The Wetland LSA was established to incorporate the area in which wetlands are most likely to be affected 
by construction and operation of the proposed pipeline. The spatial boundaries of the Wetland LSA 
(Figure 6.6) for the Project are defined as a 300 m wide band centred on the proposed pipeline route 
(i.e., 150 m on both sides of the centre line). Key considerations used to establish the spatial boundaries 
of the Wetland LSA for the proposed pipeline route were intended to encompass those wetlands located 
within the Footprint as well as wetlands potentially susceptible to habitat, hydrological and biogeochemical 
changes immediately adjacent to the construction right-of-way. This spatial boundary encompasses the 
ZOI in which vegetation element occurrences are expected to be affected by construction and operations 
of the proposed pipeline, both directly and indirectly, however, also extends further to encompass local 
surface water connectivity adjacent to the proposed pipeline route. Element occurrences are defined as the 
area in which an element, such as vegetation species or community, is present or was previously 
documented, and often refer to a local population of a species or stand of a particular community 
(NatureServe 2002). The methodology outlined by NatureServe (2002) identifies the minimum distance for 
assessing element occurrences as being 1 km (NatureServe 2002). This methodology is implemented by 
provincial conservation data centres, such as the ACIMS, to define elements of concern, including listed 
wetland communities, and ranks their rarity across the landscape. The ZOI is unlikely to extend greater

than the Wetland LSA boundary due to the implementation of mitigation measures during and after 
construction. The Wetland LSA aligns with the Vegetation LSA, as changes in vegetation (i.e., species or 
communities) are expected to be a gauge of effects on wetland function. Wetland LSA information was 
gathered through a combination of a desktop review and field investigations. As previously noted, there are 
no wetlands within 30 m of the meter station and, therefore, that component is not considered further in this 
section. 

The Wetland RSA is intended to incorporate the area in which wetlands have the potential to be directly 
and indirectly affected by construction and operation of the proposed pipeline. The spatial boundaries of 
the Wetland RSA (Figure 6.6) for the proposed pipeline route are defined as a 30 km wide band centred on 
the proposed pipeline route centre line (i.e., 15 km on both sides of the centre line). A key consideration in 
defining the Wetland RSA is the understanding that the local and regional hydrology is the overall driver of 
wetland occurrence. Waterbodies, wetlands and riparian areas that are associated with the hydrology of 
wetlands along the proposed pipeline route will be encompassed by the Wetland RSA. The Wetland RSA 
intends to encompass the area where the direct and indirect influence of other land uses and activities 
could overlap with Project-specific effects and cause cumulative effects on wetlands directly affected by 
construction as well as operations of the proposed pipeline route. The Wetland RSA aligns with the Aquatics 
RSA, as hydrology is the overall driver for both wetlands and aquatic ecosystems. Wetland RSA information 
was gathered through desktop review (e.g., literature and data review, satellite interpretation).

6.2.8.2 Ecological Context 

The pipeline route is located within the Continental Mid-Boreal wetlands within the Mid-boreal Wetland 
Region. Continental Mid-Boreal wetlands are primarily bogs and fens. Marsh wetlands may be found along 
gently sloping lakeshores. The average peat depth is approximately 4 m (Natural Resources Canada 1986). 

The proposed pipeline route crosses the Central Mixedwood Natural Subregion of the Boreal Forest Natural 
Region for approximately 16.8 km. The Project travels through the Upper Foothills Natural Subregion for 
approximately 3.1 km and approximately 18.4 km through the Lower Foothills Natural Subregion, both 
components of the Foothills Natural Region (Natural Regions Committee 2006). 

Potential wetlands along the proposed pipeline route were identified through a desktop review of satellite 
imagery using key indicators such as terrain, surficial material (i.e., hydric mineral soils), vegetation cover 
and the presence/absence of surficial hydrology. Wetland presence was confirmed during the 2014 wetland 
helicopter reconnaissance and helicopter-supported ground-based wetland surveys. All wetlands that are 
crossed by the pipeline route are identified on the Environmental Alignment Sheets (Appendix 2).  

The 2014 wetland evaluation identified 5 wetland ecosystems comprising approximately 2.8% (0.9 km) of 
the length of the proposed pipeline route. Wetlands crossed include one basin bog (treed bog), one riparian 
swamp (mixedwood treed swamp), one flat swamp (shrubby swamp), one channel marsh (wet meadow) 
and one basin fen (shrubby fen). All five of these wetlands are crossed by the proposed construction 
right-of-way and temporary workspace. An additional wetland, a riparian marsh (seasonal emergent marsh) 
(Wetland Reference 2), was identified approximately 25 m east of KP 4.6 (SW 12-68-7 W6M), which is not 
crossed by the pipeline route but is located within the Wetlands LSA. 

6.2.8.3 Potential Effects, Mitigation Measures and Potential Residual Effects  

The potential effects associated with the construction and operation of the pipeline on wetland function 
were identified by federal and provincial government agencies, Aboriginal communities, landowners, and 
the assessment team, and are listed in Table 6.17. Members of Kelly Lake Cree Nation, Kelly Lake Métis 
Settlement Society, Aseniwuche Winewak Nation of Canada, Horse Lake First Nation and Métis Nation of 
Alberta Association Region 6 shared TEK-related to wetlands during field studies for the Project. Concerns 
that were identified by Aboriginal participants during biophysical field studies can be found Table 2-3 of 
Appendix 8. 

Mitigation measures recommended to reduce the severity of potential effects of pipeline construction on 
wetlands have been incorporated into Table 6.17. These measures were developed in accordance with 
several industry and provincial regulatory guidelines, including AENV (1988, 1994b) as well as 
peer-reviewed publications on wetland function (Price et al. 2005, Ryder et al. 2005, Shem et al. 1993, Van 
dyke et al. 1994) and in accordance with NGTL standards.

Wetlands are complex ecological systems and, consequently, evaluation of wetlands for the purposes of 
environmental impact assessments tends to focus on wetland health and function. The Federal Policy on 
Wetland Conservation (FPWC) commits all federal departments to the goal of “no net loss” of wetland 
function on federal lands and waters (Environment Canada 1991, Lynch-Stewart 1992, 
Lynch-Stewart et al. 1996). 

The objective of the FPWC is to promote conservation of Canada’s wetlands to sustain their ecological and 
socio-economic functions. To support this objective, several goals have been established by the FPWC. 
These objectives include: 

• “no net loss” of wetland function on federal lands or projects; 

• enhancement and rehabilitation of wetlands in areas where the continuing loss, or 
degradation of wetlands or their functions has reached a critical level; and 

• recognition of wetland functions in resource planning, management and economic 
decision-making with regard to all federal programs, policies and activities. 

The goal of the new Alberta Wetland Policy, to be implemented in the Green Area of Alberta in 2015, is to 
conserve, restore, protect and manage Alberta’s wetlands (AENV 2013b). The objectives of the policy 
include: 

• wetlands of the highest value are to be protected for the long-term benefit of all Albertans; 

• wetlands and their benefits are to be conserved and restored in areas where losses have 
been high; 

• wetlands are to be managed by avoiding, minimizing and, if necessary, replacing lost 
wetland value; and 

• wetland management will be considered in a regional context. 

Where feasible, the pipeline has been routed to reduce potential effects on wetlands by implementing a 
routing decision framework that takes into consideration the following: 

• scheduling construction and clean-up activities during frozen conditions and 
implementing a monitoring program to document wetland function recovery following 
construction to ensure the goal of “no net loss” has been met; and  

• minimizing length traversing environmentally sensitive areas such as protected, 
endangered or sensitive vegetation and wildlife habitat. 

6.2.8.4 Significance Evaluation of Potential Residual Effects 

A combined qualitative and quantitative assessment approach was taken to determine the extent of the 
Project’s wetland function disturbance (i.e., potential loss or alteration of wetland function). The area of 
wetlands determined to be within the Footprint and Wetland LSA was based on the approximate area of 
wetlands crossed by the pipeline route, identified during satellite imagery interpretation and helicopter 
reconnaissance. 

As there is a lack of regulatory thresholds, standards or guidelines relating to disturbance of wetland 
function, the evaluation of significance of the potential residual effects was determined by qualitative 
assessment supported by quantitative information. This assessment relied on available research literature 
and the professional judgement of the assessment team. 

Table 6.18 provides the rationale used to evaluate the significance evaluation of potential residual 
environmental effects of the construction and operations of the pipeline on wetland function. All assessment 
criteria were considered when determining the significance of each residual effect, but the most influential 
assessment criteria were magnitude and reversibility.

CHARACTERIZATION OF RESIDUAL EFFECTS FOR 
EVALUATION OF SIGNIFICANCE - WETLANDS 

Potential 
Residual Effect Criteria Rating Effects Characterization Rationale 

a. Loss or 
alteration of 
wetland habitat 
function during 
and following 
pipeline 
construction 
and 
maintenance 
activities until 
vegetation is 
re-established 

Impact balance: 
Negative 

• Wetland habitat function may be disturbed during construction 
or operation (i.e., maintenance). 

Spatial boundary: 
Wetland LSA 

• The loss or alteration of habitat function (e.g., changes in 
species composition, stress on plant species, interruption of 
wildlife movements and fragmentation of natural habitats) 
resulting from construction of the pipeline, operations and 
maintenance activities may extend beyond the Footprint. 

Duration: Short-Term • The event causing loss or alteration of habitat function is 
pipeline construction, operations and maintenance activities 
(e.g., integrity digs), the latter of which may be completed 
within any given year during the operations phase. 

Frequency: Periodic • The events causing loss or alteration of habitat function (i.e., 
construction of the pipeline, operations and maintenance 
activities) will occur intermittently, however, may occur 
repeatedly over the assessment period. 

Reversibility: 
Medium to Long-
Term 

• Depending on the growth time of wetland species 
(medium-term for graminoid-dominant wetlands and long-term 
for treed wetlands) found along the pipeline route, the 
reversibility of the residual effect may take longer than 1 year, 
with the possibility of being greater than 10 years. 

Magnitude: Low • Based on the mitigation measures provided and the 
post-construction environmental monitoring literature, 
wetlands are resilient provided habitat function is not 
permanently altered. If permanent loss or alteration of wetland 
habitat function is identified upon completion of the monitoring 
of wetlands post-construction in areas anticipated to be 
temporarily disturbed, NGTL will consult with the appropriate 
regulatory body regarding potential remedial measures. 
However, permanent loss or alteration of wetland habitat 
function is not anticipated at wetlands crossed by the pipeline 
route as pipeline construction and maintenance through 
wetlands is considered to be a temporary disturbance and 
experience indicates that residual effects on wetland habitat 
function can be mitigated. Long-term alteration of wetland 
habitat function may result during pipeline construction in 
treed wetlands (e.g., treed wetlands will regenerate as

Loss or Alteration of Wetland Habitat Function 
Pipeline construction and maintenance activities within wetlands will likely result in some disruption of the 
function of wetlands and this is considered to have a negative impact balance. Examples of potential 
adverse environmental effects on wetland habitat function are: potential changes in vegetative species 
composition; stress on vegetative species; interruption of wildlife movements; and fragmentation of natural 
habitats.  

With proper construction methods and mitigation measures (e.g., profile contours returned and the 
appropriate protection and use of the seedbanks), these adverse effects can be successfully reduced. For 
example, Zimmerman and Wilkey (1992) monitored wetlands for effects on vegetation for 20 years 
post-disruption from pipeline construction. Findings of these long-term monitoring programs show that 
adjacent natural wetland areas were not altered in habitat type (e.g., species composition) when the proper 
construction and mitigation measures were carried out (i.e., wetland contours and elevations match those 
off the construction right-of-way), no non-native plant species invaded natural areas, and the right-of-way 
increased in diversity.  

Additional studies on the effects of pipeline construction on wetland vegetation (Shem et al. 1993, Van 
Dyke et al. 1994) report the following observations.

• Wetland community effects: At most sites, many plants from adjacent natural areas re-establish 
themselves on the right-of-way. Rights-of-way that have been constructed in a manner where wetland 
function is not lost (e.g., profile contours returned and the appropriate restoration or maintenance of 
the seedbanks through ensuring equipment arrives on-site clean and kept free of vegetative debris 
during construction) appear to have little effect on vegetation in the natural areas. 

• Wetland species diversity: A greater number of wetland plants have been observed on the right-of-way 
than in the adjacent natural area. Rights-of-way increase the number and types of habitats in wetlands 
due to the growth of a variety of succession species within the right-of-way. Although the impact balance 
on wetlands resulting from the disturbance created by the pipeline construction is negative (see 
Table 6.18), increased biodiversity on the right-of-way is viewed positively since the plants that are 
regenerating on the right-of-way are native succession species that occur within the natural wetland 
habitat and the result is that overall habitat function is not negatively impacted. 

• Construction and management practices: Overall, vegetative cover on rights-of-way in wetlands in a 
variety of control plots (i.e., various wetland types in areas throughout the United States) is generally 
well-established within 1 to 3 years after pipeline construction when mitigation measures included 
returning wetland contours and elevations to pre-construction conditions. Minor differences in the final 
right-of-way surface elevation can strongly influence the type of vegetation that re-establishes on the 
right-of-way. Other examples of construction and management practices that ensure wetland 
vegetation will re-establish include conducting ground-level cutting, mowing or mulching of wetland 
vegetation instead of grubbing, directing grading away from wetlands and allowing natural recovery 
(i.e., not seeding wetlands). 

The effects of construction of a pipeline right-of-way on wetland vegetation and bird communities were 
investigated up to 2 years following construction by Santillo (1993). Results showed that at two years 
post-construction, wetlands were dominated by native hydrophytic graminoids. Also, in wetlands with no 
standing water, plant community composition and structure were found to be similar at the end of two years 
following construction to what was observed pre-construction. The results also indicated that no new bird 
species were observed following pipeline construction even though different habitat initially became 
established on the right-of-way. It was determined that as the pipeline was constructed using appropriate 
mitigation measures (e.g., re-establishing pre-construction contours within the wetland boundary to ensure 
cross right-of-way drainage) and because seedbanks were restored on the construction right-of-way there 
is a high likelihood that similar habitat to what was present off of the construction right-of-way would, in 
time, re-establish in shrubby or graminoid wetlands. Increased plant diversity is discussed here as a finding 
of research presented in peer-reviewed available research literature (Santillo 1993, Shem et al. 1993, Van 
Dyke et al. 1994, Zimmerman and Wilkey 1992). The conclusion of the research was that although there 
was increased native plant diversity as a result of pipeline construction, the overall habitat function of the 
wetlands was not negatively impacted.  

Increased biodiversity is viewed positively since the plants that are regenerating on the right-of-way are 
native wetland species, therefore, wetland habitat is not substantially altered. By opening up the canopy, 
plant species that generally cannot grow beneath a tree or shrub overstory will return to begin the plant 
succession stages and additional species will begin to colonize the area. This increase in biodiversity may 
occur along the pipeline route since disturbed peatlands have tree/shrub cover removed during 
construction. Initially, wetlands that were previously dominated by woody vegetation recover as 
sedge-dominant marshes due to an increased moisture regime as a result of decreased rates of 
evapotranspiration. 

Salvaging of soils during construction removes microtopography features (i.e., hummocks and hollows) that 
provide important microclimates. Loss of the habitat variation provided by microtopography features can 
slow regeneration of wetland vegetation and habitat (Lee and Boutin 2006). Restoration of microtopography 
features and microclimate variation following construction (e.g., natural recovery in wetlands) accelerates 
plant community development and re-establishment (Belyea 1996, Kellner and Halldin 2002, Malmar and 
Wallén 1999, Miller 2011). 

Past construction projects of similar scale have successfully reduced effects on wetlands. Post-construction 
environmental monitoring of wetland function (TERA 2011b-d, 2012a-c) at wetlands along recent large

pipeline projects has shown that mitigation measures implemented during construction (e.g., profile 
reconstruction, allowing natural regeneration) can be successful and wetlands have proven to be resilient. 
In addition, the absence of environmental issues pertaining to wetland function restoration has been 
observed and documented in as-built environmental reports for the first, second and third-year PCM 
reporting for numerous past pipeline projects (Interprovincial Pipe Line 1995, TERA Environmental 
Consultants [Alta] Ltd. 1995, 1996, 2000, 2001a,b, TERA 2002, 2003, 2004, 2009, 2011b-d, 2012a-c). By 
utilizing the proven and effective mitigation measures from past projects, it is anticipated that the residual 
effect on wetland habitat function is considered to be reversible in the medium-term and of low magnitude 
(Table 6.18, point [a]). 

Loss or Alteration of Hydrological Function at Wetlands  
Pipeline installation or maintenance may cause potential changes to the hydrologic flow (i.e., surface or 
groundwater flow) of a wetland by diverting water away from the wetland and/or impeding natural flow 
through the wetland. Excessive water diversion will result in an unnatural decrease of water flow within the 
wetland while flow impedance (i.e., inadequate drainage) results in a more saturated wetland habitat.  

Each of these alterations is an interruption to the natural hydrologic regime and is considered to have a 
negative impact balance. The vertical and horizontal water movements in wetlands are readily disrupted by 
any berm-like structure. For example, linear disturbances, such as pipelines and roads, can impound water 
on the upstream side of a wetland resulting in drying downstream and flooding upstream. Drying on the 
downslope face in treed wetlands (i.e., treed bogs and fens) can increase tree productivity, water demand 
and evapotranspiration, which facilitates further drying (Baisley 2012, Miller et al. in prep). In mineral 
wetlands, this type of disturbance (i.e., drying downstream) may also result in increases in productivity of 
drought-tolerant wetland plant species (e.g., grasses, some sedges and rushes) and water demand, which, 
similar to treed wetlands, can lead to further drying. The compounded drying can result in permanent 
alteration of peatland and mineral wetland hydrologic regime, overall wetland function and, potentially, 
ecosystem type (e.g., treed wetland to forest or marsh to wet meadow or moist grassland) (Baisley 2012, 
Miller et al. in prep, Sherwood 2012). On the upstream side, increased saturation from impounded water 
can result in the loss of trees and other woody vegetation, while allowing for the establishment of emergent 
vegetation in peatlands (Miller 2011), whereas in seasonal mineral wetlands, increased inundation may 
result in the decrease of emergent vegetation, the increase in aquatic vegetation and open water 
characteristics. Prolonged impoundment may potentially convert a treed wetland to an open water or marsh 
wetland and a more seasonal mineral wetland into a more permanent open water wetland. 

The hydraulic conductivity of the wetland’s substrate can also be affected by salvaging, compacting or 
mixing of the soil structure. For example, salvaging of the acrotelm (i.e., the unsaturated portion of the peat 
profile near the surface) during pipeline construction affects water storage capacity, evaporative losses as 
well as soil processes (e.g., carbon storage) (Price et al. 2003). Pore structure is impacted through 
subsidence and compression when peat is drained, which impacts water storage capacity and hydraulic 
conductivity (Price et al. 2003). Overlaying woody mulch on replaced peat following pipeline construction 
can increase the relative humidity on the peat surface and decrease evaporative loss thereby reducing the 
hydrologic impact (Groeneveld and Rochefort 2005, Price et al. 2003). However, lessons learned from PCM 
programs have shown that the thickness of mulch can have an impact on vegetation regrowth if placed too 
thickly. In mineral wetlands, improper handling (i.e., admixing, salvaged material drying) of salvaged mineral 
soil and wetland substrate can result in loss of salvaged material through wind erosion (i.e., drying of 
material while stockpiled). Improper replacement of bottom soils can affect the permeability of the material 
(i.e., permeable substrate becoming impermeable) as the result of admixing and compaction. These issues 
can affect a wetland’s ability to retain and slowly release flood waters to the groundwater, increase 
evaporative losses of stored water and limit a wetland’s storage capacity (i.e., volume of water a wetland 
can retain). Storing salvaged material separately (i.e., mineral soil separate from wetland substrate) and 
maintaining the moisture content can mitigate the effect of wind erosion, while replacing salvaged material 
in the correct order (i.e., mineral soil followed by wetland substrate) following construction can help to 
maintain bottom soil permeability, therefore, maintaining a wetland’s hydraulic conductivity capability. 

Among the most important considerations for limiting disturbances to hydrological function are assuring that 
the restoration of pre-construction elevations and contours are achieved (Gartman 1991), and that there 
will be no unnatural impedance to flow. Short-term disturbances to wetlands are expected during pipeline 
construction. Some alteration of hydrological function in wetlands can be expected during trenching,

however, the fall/winter construction schedules will reduce the severity of potential hydrologic changes 
since water flow is likely to be diminishing from peak levels. This will reduce the severity of potential changes 
in the hydrological function of wetlands. If the construction right-of-way in the wetland is restored to its 
pre--construction profile and proper hydrologic throughflow is ensured by replacement of salvaged wetland 
substrates/upper soils, long-term effects on wetland hydrological function are not expected. 
Post-construction monitoring of wetland hydrological function (TERA 2011e-g, 2012d, 2013b,c) at wetlands 
along existing pipeline routes has shown that mitigation measures implemented during construction 
(e.g., profile reconstruction) can be successful in returning surface water to pre-construction levels. 
Seedbank moisture regime recovery (i.e., vegetation growth due to moisture), however, has proven to occur 
more slowly since surface material moisture levels are regulated either from vegetation removal (resulting 
in a wetter moisture regime than previous) or the drier conditions commonly present at wetland margins.  

Standard pipeline construction and operation activities are designed to avoid circumstances that result in 
diversion and natural flow impedance of water in wetlands. With the implementation of the proposed 
mitigation measures, the residual effect of pipeline construction and maintenance activities on wetland 
hydrology is considered to be reversible in the medium-term and of low magnitude (Table 6.18, point [b]).  

Loss or Alteration of Wetland Biogeochemical Function 
Changes in wetland hydrologic regime can directly and indirectly impact wetland biogeochemical function. 
Directly, hydrologic regime can impact soil processes, nutrient availability and water chemistry. For 
example, soil decomposition rates are controlled by microbial respiration, which is impacted by temperature 
and oxygen availability. Microbes preferentially use oxygen, however, under anaerobic, saturated 
conditions the rate and type of respiration is altered (McLatchey and Reddy 1998). Additionally, the heat 
capacity of saturated soils is higher than that of dry soils. Therefore, decomposition rates are protected by 
hydrologic regime through saturated conditions. 

Impounding water flow due to linear disturbance can also directly impact wetland biogeochemistry. Fen 
peatlands receive nutrient inputs from sources found on or in the ground. By impeding water flow, nutrient 
delivery to downstream parts of the wetland is limited.  

Activity in or near wetlands during pipeline construction may result in an increased sediment supply and 
turbidity of surface waters (particularly in mineral wetlands), thereby impacting biogeochemical function of 
the wetland. However, given the application of sedimentation control mitigation measures (i.e., silt fencing), 
the likelihood of alteration in this manner is reduced.  

Indirectly, hydrologic regime can impact biogeochemical function by altering wetland habitat function. For 
example, decreases in water table position can increase tree productivity rates, which could decrease the 
quality of litter deposited to soil to increase nutrient turnover times. This can change understory community 
composition due to nutrient and light limitations, soil processes (e.g., decomposition rates) as well as further 
stimulating changes in wetland hydrologic regime through increased transpiration and interception 
(Baisley 2012, Kotowska 2012, Laiho et al. 2003). 

Due to historical peat accumulation, peatlands represent a large reservoir of soil carbon and are estimated 
to store approximately 30% of the world’s soil carbon pool, and about 85% of North America’s soil carbon 
is stored in peatlands (Bridgeham et al. 2006, Zoltai and Martikainen 1996). Differences in peatland 
microtopography (i.e., hummocks versus hollows) help maintain wetland biogeochemical function, 
particularly carbon cycling (Belyea 1996, Benscoter et al. 2011, Malmar and Wallén 1999, 
Rydin et al. 2006). Removing the microtopographical variation within these wetlands through construction 
and compaction removes the important role they have within ecosystem function (Lee and Boutin 2006, 
Turcheneck 1990).  

Mitigation measures will be employed during construction and maintenance activities to ensure that the 
severity of potential effects on wetland biogeochemistry is reduced. Mitigation measures are discussed in 
Table 6.17. With the implementation of these measures, the residual effects of pipeline construction on 
wetland biogeochemistry are considered to be of low magnitude and reversible in the medium to long-term 
(Table 6.18, point [c]).

Effects of Accidents and Malfunctions on Wetlands 
In the unlikely event of a major fuel spill from equipment or a fuel truck near a waterbody, infiltration into 
surficial deposits and surface water is possible and the effects would be considered to have a negative 
impact balance. However, construction through wetlands will take place during fall and winter conditions 
when, consequently, the amount of surface water encountered will be reduced and the speed of migration 
of any spill into the groundwater will be limited. The implementation of preventative measures (Table 6.17) 
is expected to avoid spills. If spot spills occur in wetlands the mitigation measures will be enacted to contain 
and clean up the spill. Spill mitigation is expected to result in some loss or disturbance of soil, peat and 
vegetation. In the event of a fire associated with a gas release, wetland habitat could be affected. This 
residual effect is considered to be reversible in the short to long-term depending on the wetland habitat type 
and hydrology present, and is of low to high magnitude. With mitigation efforts as well as the design of the 
pipeline and safety measures implemented to prevent a release during operation, the likelihood of a product 
release affecting wetlands is considered unlikely (Table 6.18, point [d]).  

Combined Effects on Wetlands 
The evaluation of the combined effects of pipeline construction and operation activities on wetlands 
considers the individual potential residual effects evaluated in Section 6.2.8.4 that are likely to occur (effects 
[a] through [c] of Table 6.18), and could act in combination on the function of wetlands encountered along 
the pipeline route. 

The following potential residual environmental effects are likely to act in combination to result in overall 
Project effects on wetlands along the pipeline route. 

• Loss or alteration of wetland habitat function during and following construction as well as maintenance 
activities until vegetation is re-established. 

• Loss or alteration of wetland hydrological function during and following construction as well as 
maintenance activities until grade and natural drainage patterns are restored. 

• Loss or alteration of biogeochemical function in wetlands during and following construction as well as 
maintenance activities until sedimentation is controlled and vegetation is re-established. 

The potential reduction of wetland habitat, hydrological and biogeochemical functions in the event of a spill 
during construction or fire as a result of a gas release during operation are not considered in the combined 
effects on wetlands since the probability of either occurrence is low. 

The combined effects on wetlands of these potential residual effects occurring at one location would be not 
significant due to the overall low magnitude of the potential effects occurring in combination at a particular 
location. This conclusion is based on the high probability of the successful implementation of mitigation 
measures immediately following construction and maintenance activities to restore the reconstruction 
grade, re-establish natural flow patterns and control sedimentation (Table 6.18, point [e]). 

6.2.8.5 Summary 

As identified in Table 6.18, there are no situations where there is a high probability of occurrence of a 
permanent or long-term residual environmental effect on wetlands of high magnitude that cannot be 
technically or economically mitigated. Consequently, it is concluded that the residual environmental effects 
of pipeline construction and operation on wetlands as well as their habitat, hydrological and biogeochemical 
functions will be not significant.

centred in the centre of the meter station (i.e., meter station, valve site, access road and valve site tie-in) 
(Figure 6.7). The Vegetation LSA was established to incorporate the area in which vegetation resources 
are most likely to be affected by the construction and operation of the Project. 

Key considerations in defining the Vegetation RSA were the separation distance typically used to 
distinguish one rare plant population from another and the distance at which wind effects (as a result of 
clearing) may extend into an area of native vegetation. The Vegetation RSA for the Project is defined as a 
5 km wide band centred on the proposed pipeline route centre line (i.e., 2.5 km on both sides of the centre 
line) and a 2.5 km radius in the centre of the meter station (Figure 6.7).

6.2.9.2 Ecological Context 

The Project is situated entirely on forested Crown lands within the Boreal Plains Ecozone (Environment 
Canada 2010). The pipeline is located within the Central Mixedwood Natural Subregions of the Boreal 
Forest Natural Region and the Lower Foothills and the Upper Foothills Natural Subregions of the Foothills 
Natural Region (Natural Regions Committee 2006). The meter station is located within the Upper Foothills 
Natural Subregion of the Foothills Natural Region (Natural Regions Committee 2006). 

The Project encounters approximately 67 ha of native vegetation and the pipeline parallels existing 
rights-of-way for approximately 78% of its length. Vegetation communities observed along the pipeline route 
include deciduous (aspen), mixedwood (white spruce and lodgepole pine) and coniferous forests 
(lodgepole pine and black spruce), as well as shrublands. The pipeline route crosses several cutblocks in 
various stages of regeneration. 

A vegetation survey was conducted by vegetation specialists in 2014 along the pipeline route (Appendix 5). 
The purpose of the vegetation survey was to search for rare vegetation, rare ecological communities, 
late-successional forests, forest pests, along with non-native and invasive species during the growing 
season. Mitigation measures to reduce the severity of the potential effects of the proposed project on 
vegetation are provided in the EPP (Appendix 1). Key mitigation measures are summarized in Table 6.19. 

6.2.9.3 Potential Effects, Mitigation Measures and Potential Residual Effects 

The pipeline route follows existing disturbances to the extent practical (approximately 78% of the total 
Project length) and the construction right-of-way width has been reduced where possible by overlapping 
with existing TransCanada rights-of-way. Potential effects on vegetation associated with the construction 
and operation of the pipeline and meter station were identified by the assessment team and are listed in 
Table 6.19.  

Aboriginal community representatives were invited to participate in the vegetation survey and shared TEK 
related to vegetation during field studies for the Project. Concerns related to vegetation that were identified 
by Aboriginal participants during biophysical field studies can be found in Table 2-4 of the TK Report 
(Appendix 8). 

Mitigation is developed with a number of factors taken into account that include, however, are not limited 
to:  

• the position of the vegetation or ecological community on the construction right-of-way; 

• the relative rarity of the vegetation or ecological community (regionally, federally, etc.); 

• the local abundance of the vegetation or ecological community; 

• the growth habit and propagation strategy of the vegetation or ecological community; 

• the habitat preferences of the vegetation or ecological community; 

• species;  

• growth form of the vegetation (i.e., annual, biennial and perennial);  

• construction timing;  

• primary mode of species reproduction;  

• habitat and proximity of available habitat; and  

• past mitigation success (of the species or similar species).  

Mitigation measures based on these factors are provided in the EPP (Appendix 1) and Table 6.19.

primarily completed under frozen 
conditions [Section 8.3]. 

• Rollback coarse woody debris and 
small diameter, non-merchantable 
timber on erosion prone slopes when 
deemed necessary by the 
Environmental Inspector. Walk down 
erosion control rollback with a dozer. 
(Refer to Appendix 1D, Dwg. STDS-03-
ML-05-312) [Section 8.8]. 

• Reduce grubbing near watercourses, 
muskeg, and other wet areas to 
facilitate the restoration of shrub 
communities [Section 8.2]. 

• Natural recovery is the preferred 
method of reclamation on level terrain 
where erosion is not expected 
[Sections 8.8].  

• Complete machine clean-up 
immediately following construction, 
prior to spring break-up. If machine 
clean-up cannot be completed prior to 
spring break-up, ensure cross right-of-
way drainage is re-established, and 
sedimentation and erosion controls are 
installed to protect the right-of-way and 
sensitive environmental features. Final 
clean-up and reclamation will generally 
occur during the following fall and/or 
winter, or as soon as conditions permit 
[Section 8.8]. 

• Seed riparian and erosion prone areas 
with a native cover crop and seed mix 
that has been approved by the 
applicable regulatory agency. Seeding 
will follow as close as possible to rough 
clean-up and surface material 
replacement pending seasonal or 
weather conditions [Section 8.8].

Plan (Appendix 1E). 

• Restrict general application of 
herbicide near rare vegetation 
populations or rare ecological 
communities. Spot spraying, wicking, 
mowing or hand-picking are acceptable 
measures for weed control in these 
areas [Section 7.1].  

• Clearly mark identified rare vegetation 
locations before the start of right-of-
way and meter station preparation and 
construction [Section 7.1]. 

• Review mitigation for rare 
vegetation/rare ecological communities 
with Contractor personnel in advance 
of construction to ensure there is full 
understanding of the procedures 
involved [Section 7.1].

the Environmental Inspector(s), or 
designate, and if deemed to be in 
appropriate condition will be identified 
with a suitable marker or tag. Any 
equipment which arrives in a dirty 
condition shall not be allowed on the 
right-of-way or meter station until it has 
been cleaned [Section 7.1]. 

• Conduct shovel and sweep or 
compressed air cleaning before moving 
equipment from any locations identified 
as having a noxious weed infestation 
[Section 7.1]. 

• Additional mitigation to reduce weed 
growth and spread may be warranted if 
grade/strippings replacement is 
delayed due to construction scheduling 
[Section 7.1]. 

• Acquire Certificates of Analysis for all 
seed mixes [Section 8.8].

6.2.9.4 Significance Evaluation of Potential Residual Effects 

A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods was considered the most appropriate method to 
evaluate the significance of potential residual effects on vegetation, depending on the availability of 
quantitative data and accepted standards, guidelines and ecological thresholds. Where appropriate, the 
qualitative assessment relied on available research literature and the professional judgement of the 
assessment team.  

Table 6.20 provides a summary of the significance evaluation of potential residual environmental effects of 
the construction and operation of the pipeline and meter station on vegetation. The rationale used to 
evaluate the significance of each of the residual environmental effects is provided below. An evaluation of 
significance is required for those potential effects where residual effect has been identified (i.e., weed 
introduction and spread).

Negative 

• Areas of native vegetation within the Project Footprint will be

• The alteration of native vegetation is confined to the pipeline 
right-of-way and meter station boundaries where construction 
and clean-up activities are planned to occur. 

Duration: Short-

• The event causing an alteration of native vegetation is 
construction of the Project or maintenance activities 
(e.g., vegetation management, integrity digs along the pipeline 
right-of-way), the latter of which may be completed within any 
given year during the operations phase.

Potential 
Residual Effect Criteria Rating Effects Characterization Rationale 

a. Changes to 
composition of 
approximately 
67 ha of native 
vegetation 
(cont’d) 

Frequency: Isolated 
to periodic 

• The pipeline and meter station construction is an isolated 
occurrence. Periodic events causing an alteration of native 
vegetation (e.g., vegetation management, integrity digs along 
the pipeline right-of-way) will occur intermittently, however 
repeatedly over the assessment period.  

Reversibility: 
Medium to 
Long-Term 

• The pipeline will be allowed to revegetate following 
construction, but will be maintained at an early structural 
stage. Native vegetation along the pipeline will re-establish in 
the medium-term. Following decommissioning of the Project, 
native vegetation along the pipeline will no longer be 
maintained at an early structural stage and native vegetation 
will re-establish on the facility site in the long-term. 

Magnitude: Low  • With the implementation of the mitigation measures provided, 
the residual effect of the construction and operation of the 
Project on native vegetation is concluded to be of low 
magnitude. 

Probability: High • The pipeline and meter station encounter native vegetation. 
Confidence: High • The assessment is based on a good understanding of cause-

effect relationships and data pertinent to the Project area due 
to completed projects with a similar scope (i.e., pipeline and 
facility construction) and the experience of the assessment 
team. 

Significance: Not 
Significant  

• The changes to native vegetation are reversible in the 
medium to long-term and are of low magnitude and, therefore, 
not significant. 

b. Alteration of 
approximately 
11.2 ha of 
late-successional 
forest 

Impact balance: 
Negative 

• The alteration of late-successional forests reduces forest 
structure complexity and biodiversity. 

Spatial boundary: 
Project Footprint 

• The alteration of late-successional forest is confined to the 
pipeline right-of-way and temporary workspace boundaries 
where clearing activities are planned to occur. 

Duration: Short-
Term 

• The event causing alteration of late-successional forest is 
clearing during the construction of the Project. 

Frequency: Isolated • The event causing alteration of late-successional forest (i.e., 
construction of the pipeline) is confined to a specific period. 

Reversibility: Long-
Term 

• The reversal of residual effects in late-successional forests 
will take more than 10 years. 

Magnitude: Low • There will be alteration of 11.2 ha of late-successional forest 
(which is 0.9 % of the late-successional forest in the RSA). 
Industrial timber salvage is expected to occur within the 
Weyerhaeuser Grande Prairie FMA and is taken into 
consideration when implementing the annual allowable cuts 
as outlined in the forest management plan to ensure 
late-successional forest sustainability (Weyerhaeuser 2011). 
This incremental change in the abundance of 
late-successional forest is within the management objectives 
of Weyerhauser Grande Prairie, and therefore, is considered 
to be of low magnitude. 

Probability: High • Late-successional forest was identified during the vegetation 
survey (see Section 2.2.4 in Appendix 5). 

Confidence: High • The assessment is based on an understanding of cause-effect 
relationships gained through other completed projects in this 
area that have addressed late-successional forests.

• This effect is reversible in the long-term and is considered to 
be of low magnitude and, therefore, is not significant. 

c. Loss or alteration 
of rare 
vegetation 
populations or 
rare ecological 
communities 

 

Impact balance: 
Negative 

• A disturbance or alteration to a portion of rare vegetation 
populations or rare ecological communities will occur. 

Spatial boundary: 
Vegetation LSA 

• The potential disturbance or alteration of a rare vegetation 
population or rare ecological community will occur in the 
Footprint, whereas indirect impacts to rare vegetation 
populations or rare ecological communities as a result of 
changes in hydrology or light levels may affect populations 
that extend beyond the construction right-of-way into the 
Vegetation LSA. 

Duration: Short-
Term 

• The event causing potential loss or alteration of rare 
vegetation populations or rare ecological communities is 
construction of the pipeline and meter station or maintenance 
activities (e.g., vegetation management, integrity digs along 
the pipeline right-of-way), the latter of which may be 
completed within any given year during the operations phase. 

Frequency: Isolated 
to Periodic 

• The events causing potential loss or alteration of rare 
vegetation populations or rare ecological communities are 
construction and maintenance activities which occur 
intermittently, however, may occur repeatedly over the 
assessment period. 

Reversibility: 
Medium to 
Long-Term 

• Depending upon the species, habitat sensitivity and 
population demographics of rare vegetation populations, rare 
ecological communities, and associated Element Occurrences 
directly or indirectly affected by construction activities of the 
Project. 

Magnitude: Low • Site-specific mitigation, as described in Appendix 1, will be 
implemented for rare vegetation populations which will reduce 
the alteration to those populations. With applied mitigation, no 
rare vegetation populations are expected to be lost due to the 
Project. No rare ecological communities were observed during 
the surveys. The potential residual effect to rare vegetation 
populations and rare ecological communities is considered to 
be of low magnitude. 

Probability: High • The pipeline and meter station are located in areas of 
predominantly native vegetation and five rare vegetation 
populations have been identified along the construction right-
of-way. There is high probability that there will be direct 
effects to four of the rare vegetation populations. One 
population of snakeskin liverwort is located off the 
construction right-of-way in the Vegetation LSA and there is 
potential for the Project to have indirect effects (e.g., caused 
by changes in light or moisture regime) on this population. 
The potential disturbance or alteration of a rare ecological 
community is unlikely as there were no rare ecological 
communities observed during the vegetation surveys.

Confidence: High • Determination of significance is based on a good 
understanding of rare species from the area and PCM 
Program results which have resulted in a good understanding 
of cause and effect. 

Significance: Not 
Significant  

• The residual effects on rare vegetation species and rare

term and of low magnitude and are, therefore, considered to 
be not significant. 

d. Weed 
introduction or

Impact balance: 
Negative 

• Potential introduction of Noxious weeds and introduction and 
spread of invasive, non-native species. 

Spatial boundary: 
Vegetation RSA 

• Potential weed introduction and spread resulting from Project 
construction and maintenance activities may extend beyond 
the Footprint and Vegetation LSA to the Vegetation RSA. 

Duration: Short-
Term 

• The event causing potential weed introduction and spread is 
construction of the pipeline and meter station or maintenance 
activities (e.g., vegetation management, integrity digs along 
the pipeline right-of-way), the latter of which may be 
completed within any given year during the operations phase. 

Frequency: Isolated 
to periodic 

• The events causing potential weed introduction and spread 
are construction and maintenance activities which occur 
intermittently, however, may occur repeatedly over the 
assessment period. 

Reversibility: Short 
to Medium-Term 

• Depending upon the weed species and the density/distribution 
of the infestation. 

Magnitude: Low • Depending upon the species, affected land use and 
density/distribution of associated weed occurrences, the 
residual effect meets the requirements of the Alberta Weed 
Control Act. The implementation of weed control mitigation will 
result in low magnitude effect (Appendix 1). 

Probability: High • Weeds and invasive, non-native species are known to occur 
in the Vegetation RSA. 

Confidence: High • The assessment is based on a good understanding of cause-
effect relationships and data pertinent to the Project area due 
to completed projects with a similar scope (i.e., pipeline and 
meter station construction) and the experience of the 
assessment team. 

Significance: Not 
Significant  

• The probability for weed introduction and/or spread to occur is 
high, however, given the mitigation measures, the magnitude 
is low and reversible in the short to medium-term and is, 
therefore, not significant. 

e. Effects of 
accidents and 
malfunctions on 
vegetation 

Impact balance: 
Negative 

• Disturbance of vegetation due to accidents and malfunctions. 

Spatial boundary: 
Vegetation RSA 

• A spill or fire resulting from Project construction and 
maintenance and operation activities may extend beyond the 
Footprint and Vegetation LSA to the Vegetation RSA. 

Duration: 
Immediate 

• The event causing effects on vegetation is a spill or fire, the 
period of which is less than or equal to 2 days during the 
construction or operations phase. 

Frequency: 
Accidental 

• A spill or fire occurs rarely during the construction or 
operations (including maintenance).

• Depending upon the volume and area affected by the spill or 
fire as well as the sensitivity to adverse residual effects of the 
vegetation affected (e.g., if spills or fires occur in the vicinity of 
rare vegetation populations or rare ecological communities). 

Magnitude: Low to 
High 

• Depending upon the type of vegetation affected. Spills or fires 
affecting common plant species or communities would likely 
be low in magnitude whereas spills or fires affecting a rare 
vegetation population or rare ecological community could 
potentially be high. 

Probability: Low • It is unlikely that a spill or fire will occur. 
Confidence: 
Moderate 

• Based on completed projects and the experience of the 
assessment team combined with the uncertainty of whether a 
spill or fire may occur. 

Significance: Not 
Significant  

• The magnitude of a residual effect associated with an 
accident or malfunction that result in the loss or alteration of a 
rare vegetation or ecological community or concern is of low 
to high magnitude, however, the probability is low and, 
therefore, considered not significant.

effects on native 
vegetation 

Impact balance: 
Negative 

• The combined effects of the individual potential residual 
effects could act in combination on native vegetation. 

Spatial boundary: 
Vegetation RSA 

• Combined effects on native vegetation resulting from Project 
construction may extend beyond the Footprint and Vegetation 
LSA to the Vegetation RSA. 

Duration: Short-
Term 

• The event causing combined effects on native vegetation is 
construction of the Project or maintenance activities 
(e.g., vegetation management, integrity digs), the latter of 
which may be completed within any given year during the 
operations phase. 

Frequency: Isolated 
to periodic 

• The events causing combined effects on native vegetation are 
construction and maintenance activities which occur 
intermittently, however, may occur repeatedly over the 
assessment period. 

Reversibility: Short 
to Long-Term 

• Depending upon the species affected, combined affects on 
native vegetation are considered reversible in the short to 
long-term. 

Magnitude: Medium • The magnitude of individual effects acting in combination on 
native vegetation is low except for accidental spills which 
range from low to high. Therefore, the magnitude of the 
combined effects on native vegetation is medium. 

Probability: Low • The pipeline route and meter station encounter native 
vegetation, however, the probability that effects will occur in 
combination at any one time is low. 

Confidence: High • Based on a good understanding of species sensitivity and 
extensive past experience with recommended mitigation 
measures and PCM Program reports for similar species and 
habitats. 

Significance: Not 
Significant  

• The probability of residual effects on native vegetation acting 
in combination is low, however the magnitude is medium and 
the reversibility is short to long-term. The combined effects 
are, therefore, not significant. 

Note: Significant Residual Environmental Effect: A high probability of occurrence of a permanent or long-term 
residual effect of high magnitude that cannot be technically or economically mitigated.

Changes to Native Vegetation Composition 
The pipeline route has been aligned to follow existing rights-of-way and other linear disturbances to the 
extent practical (approximately 78% of the route). Approximately 67 ha of native vegetation will be disturbed 
or cleared during construction of the Project and is considered to have a negative impact balance. Locations 
of native vegetation disturbed during construction and maintenance activities will be allowed to naturally 
regenerate or will be seeded with the appropriate native seed mix. Minimal disturbance methods of 
construction (narrowing the right-of-way, ramping over a population with appropriate protective material and 
mowing down shrubs rather than grubbing) which promote rapid regeneration of natural vegetation, will be 
used where possible Although areas disturbed during construction and periodic maintenance activities will 
be allowed to naturally regenerate or revegetate with the appropriate native species, species composition 
in the disturbed Footprint will be altered. The extent of altered vegetation communities will be limited by the 
implementation of mitigation measures outlined in Table 6.19 and reclamation measures will speed the 
recovery of vegetation on the disturbed Footprint. No locally or regionally adopted threshold or standard 
exists against which the incremental change in vegetation composition can be assessed. This residual 
effect is limited to the Footprint, reversible in the medium to long-term and of low magnitude (Table 6.20, 
point [a]).  

Late-Successional Forests 
Based on Phase 3 Forest Inventory maps (AENR 1970-1984) and accepted late-successional boreal forest 
tree ages, approximately 11.2 ha of late-successional forest will be cleared during construction of the 
proposed pipeline (see Section 2.2.4 in Appendix 5). The age class for late-successional forest was 
identified using Schneider 2002 and Timoney 2001. Sites with the potential to be late-successional were 
field-verified during the vegetation survey and other field components of the Project to confirm age and 
visually assess tree size, forest structure and function. Vegetation specialists compared Phase 3 Inventory 
maps, aerial imagery and current stand characteristics observed during the ground surveys to ensure the 
mapping is up to date. The pipeline was routed along existing rights-of-way and other linear disturbances 
for approximately 78% of its length which reduces new disturbance within late-successional forests. 
Although areas disturbed during construction and periodic maintenance activities will revegetate, the 
structure and complexity of the late-successional forests on the Footprint will have been altered. Timoney 
(2001) suggests that 100 years is the minimum age at which mixedwood forests (which dominate the 
proposed pipeline route) begin to display late-successional characteristics. Therefore, the reversibility has 
been determined to be long-term. The extent of disturbance to late-successional forest will be limited by 
the implementation of the mitigation measures outlined in Table 6.19 and the EPP (Appendix 1). 
Reclamation measures will speed the recovery of vegetation on the disturbed Footprint. The measures 
intended to mitigate alteration of native vegetation will also promote regeneration of late-successional 
forest. There is approximately 960 ha of late-successional forest in the Vegetation RSA. The amount of 
late-successional forest to be cleared for the Project is 11.2 ha, which is 0.9% of the late-successional 
forest within the Vegetation RSA. Industrial timber salvage is expected to occur within the Weyerhaeuser 
(Grande Prairie) FMA and will be taken into consideration when implementing the annual allowable cuts as 
outlined in the forest management plan to ensure late-successional forest sustainability. This incremental 
change in the abundance of late-successional forest is within the management objectives of the 
Weyerhaeuser Grande Prairie Forest Management Plan and Timber Supply forecasting Report (2011) and 
is considered to be of low magnitude (Table 6.20, point [b]).  

Rare Vegetation Species and Ecological Communities 
A mid-season vegetation survey was completed from June 18 to 20, 2014 for select areas with the potential 
to provide habitat for rare species and rare ecological communities. During the vegetation survey there 
were three ACIMS-listed rare vegetation species observed along the proposed pipeline. Protection 
measures and environmental management techniques for rare vegetation, identified during the vegetation 
survey are provided in the EPP (Appendix 1). Mitigation measures for rare vegetation species generally fall 
into categories of avoidance (e.g., realignment, change of work side, bore or extend bore or HDD, 
narrowing), reducing disturbance (e.g., narrowing, adjusting workspaces, ramping/matting over) and 
alternative construction/reclamation techniques (e.g., salvaging seed or sod, plant propagation, 
transplanting, separate strippings salvage, delay clearing, access management). These proposed 
mitigation measures have been used previously on other major pipeline construction projects with good 
success. Some examples are provided below.

Purple-stemmed aster (S3) was observed along the Groundbirch Mainline Pipeline Project. During the 
planning phase, in the fall of 2011, narrowing the right-of-way to the greatest extent feasible between the 
staked populations was recommended. During the second year rare plant PCM in 2013, approximately 
50 healthy plants were observed on the right-of-way (TERA Environmental Consultants 2012e). 

Golden saxifrage (S3?) was observed along the Bear River Lateral Loop No. 2 TransCanada Pipeline 
Project. During construction, in summer 2010, the right-of-way was narrowed and contours were restored 
following construction in order to maintain site hydrology. During the first year of the PCM in 2013, plants 
were observed both on and off of the right-of-way (TERA Environmental Consultants 2014a). 

Northern moonwort (S3) was observed along the Cutbank River Lateral Loop (Bald Mountain Section) 
Pipeline Project. During construction, in the winter and spring of 2011, taking extra workspace was avoided 
and where avoidance was not feasible minimizing compaction of the topsoil was achieved by installing 
ramps or matting with geotextile fabric overlain with excavated subsoil. During the first year of PCM, one 
plant was observed off the right-of-way (TERA Environmental Consultants 2014b).  

Riverbank anemone (S3) was observed along the proposed route for the Groundbirch Mainline Pipeline 
Project. During construction, in the fall and winter of 2010, where topsoil was to be stripped, a rare plant 
specialist transplanted some of the impacted plants to a suitable habitat of the right-of-way prior to 
construction. During the second year of PCM in 2013, three plants were observed within the recipient site 
(TERA Environmental Consultants 2014c). 

Snakeskin liverwort (S2) was observed along the proposed Gordondale Lateral Loop No. 2 Pipeline Project. 
During the planning phase, in the fall and winter of 2011, the cluster of thallii was relocated from its position 
on right-of-way to a habitat of similar light exposure, soil texture and moisture level approximately 30 m 
southeast of its current position. During the first-year rare plant PCM in 2013, Rare Plant Specialists visited 
the transplant location and observed the snakeskin liverwort population and suitable habitat was observed 
at the site (TERA Environmental Consultants 2014d). 

The above measures have been considered acceptable by the NEB for past NGTL projects (TERA 
Environmental Consultants 2014a-d). Based on the assessment of the rare vegetation to be encountered 
during construction, the mitigation measures described above are considered likely to be appropriate and 
applicable to the Project. However, if mitigation measures do not completely protect the site, a disturbance 
or alteration of a portion of the population or community will occur. By designing mitigation measures 
(provided in Table 6.19) based on the factors listed in Section 6.2.9.3, it is expected that any disturbance 
or alteration of a rare vegetation population would be reduced to a level such that the population is not 
placed at risk of loss. Consequently, the residual effects of the construction and maintenance of the pipeline 
and meter station on rare vegetation species are reversible in the medium to long-term and of low 
magnitude (Table 6.20, point [c]).  

Weed Introduction or Spread 
In general, invasive species are most prevalent where the ground has been disturbed by anthropogenic 
activity. The abundance of weedy species along the pipeline route during the 2014 vegetation survey was 
observed to be low to medium (Appendix 5). Mitigation measures outlined in Table 6.19 and the EPP 
(Appendix 1) are effective industry standard measures to reduce the potential for the introduction and 
spread of weeds. These measures will be implemented during both construction and maintenance 
(e.g., vegetation management, integrity dig activities) along the pipeline route. The residual effect of weed 
introduction and spread is reversible in the short to medium-term and of low magnitude (Table 6.20, 
point [d]). 

Effects of Accidents and Malfunctions on Vegetation 
Depending on the location and volume, disturbance of vegetation could occur as a result of a spill and 
associated clean-up and reclamation activities. Due to the unpredictability of a spill, mitigation typically 
implemented to prevent disturbance to vegetation would not be practical. The magnitude of this effect would 
vary depending on the severity of the spill or release, the location of the event, and the plant species or 
ecological community affected (e.g., the magnitude would be higher if a rare vegetation occurrence or rare 
ecological community is disturbed). Therefore, the magnitude of the residual effect associated with a spill

or fire that would result in the loss of a rare vegetation or ecological community would potentially be low to 
high. However, the probability of such an event occurring is low (Table 6.20, point [e]). See Section 6.2.20 
for further discussions of accidents and malfunctions.  

Combined Effects on Vegetation 
The evaluation of the combined effects of Project construction and operation activities on vegetation 
considers the individual potential residual effects evaluated in Section 6.2.9.4 that are likely to occur 
(residual effects [a] through [d]) that are likely to occur and could act in combination on native vegetation. 
The disturbance of vegetation due to gas accidents and malfunctions is not considered in the combined 
effects on vegetation since the probability of occurrence of these events is low. 

Combined Effects on Native Vegetation 
The following potential residual effects are likely to act in combination to result in overall effects on native 
vegetation: 

• changes to composition of approximately 67 ha of native vegetation; 

• loss or alteration of approximately 11.2 ha of late-successional forest; 

• loss or alteration of rare vegetation populations or rare ecological communities; and 

• weed introduction and spread. 

All of the individual potential adverse effects identified above have the potential to act in combination on 
native vegetation crossed by the Project. The probability of these residual effects acting in combination at 
any specific location in the Project Footprint is low. The magnitude of the combined effects on native 
vegetation is considered medium and, consequently, the combined effects of the Project on native 
vegetation will be not significant (Table 6.20, point [f]). 

6.2.9.5 Summary 

As identified in Table 6.20, there are no situations where there is a high probability of occurrence of a 
permanent or long-term residual environmental effect on vegetation of high magnitude that cannot be 
technically or economically mitigated. Consequently, it is concluded that the residual environmental effects 
of pipeline and meter station construction and operation on vegetation will be not significant. 

6.2.10 Wildlife and Wildlife Habitat 

6.2.10.1 Spatial Boundaries 

The spatial boundaries used in the effects assessment of wildlife and wildlife habitat considered one or 
more of the following areas: 

• a Footprint Study Area (as defined in Section 1.4);  

• a Wildlife LSA; and 

• a Wildlife RSA. 

The Wildlife LSA (Figure 6.4) incorporates the Footprint and adjacent areas of indirect disturbance. The 
Wildlife LSA is defined as an approximately 2 km wide band centred on the proposed pipeline route centre 
line (i.e., 1 km on both sides of the centre line) and a 1 km radius centred in the centre of the meter station 
components, which incorporates the area where both direct and indirect Project-specific effects are most 
likely to occur. The Wildlife RSA includes the Wildlife LSA and area beyond it, where there is potential for 
the Project to interact with other activities to contribute to cumulative effects. The RSA is defined as an 
approximate 30 km wide band centred on the pipeline route centre line (i.e., 15 km on both sides of the 
centre line) and a 15 km radius centred in the middle of the meter station components (Figure 6.4).

6.2.10.2 Ecological Context 

The effects assessment of wildlife and wildlife habitat is comprised of an analysis of the wildlife community 
and habitat types present within the Wildlife RSA for the Project. Wildlife species with federal or provincial 
conservation status are considered in this overall assessment of wildlife and wildlife habitat, in addition to 
the more common and abundant species that occur in the Wildlife RSA, including those that are important 
for subsistence, economic and cultural reasons (e.g., moose, beaver, black bear, red squirrel). Key species 
with conservation status were selected as indicators for the Species at Risk assessment in Section 6.2.11 
to provide a focused species-specific assessment. 

Land use in the Wildlife LSA and RSA includes forestry, hunting, trapping and oil and gas activities. These 
developments and resource uses have resulted in habitat loss and alteration. Clearing of vegetation, the 
creation of facilities and infrastructure, and sensory disturbance associated with development and resource 
use have affected the historical distribution and movement of wildlife.  

Management objectives and guidelines related to wildlife in the Wildlife RSA are set out by the Government 
of Alberta in the Integrated Standard and Guidelines - Enhanced Approval Process (Government of 
Alberta 2013). This document includes recommendations related to limiting access, setback distances and 
timing restrictions associated with sensitive species and guidelines for working in sensitive species ranges 
(e.g., grizzly bear zone). Where applicable, the recommendations in this document are referenced 
throughout the assessment and mitigation measures. In addition to the provincial objectives in Alberta, the 
MD of Greenview has identified wildlife-related objectives to ensure that environmentally sensitive features 
(including waterbodies, lakes, drainage areas, wildlife areas and special habitat features) are protected 
(MD of Greenview 2003). 

The meter station is located within a provincially identified Secondary Grizzly Bear Zone in the Grande 
Cache Bear Management Area (BMA 2) (AESRD 2014e, ASRD 2008). 

6.2.10.3 Potential Effects, Mitigation Measures and Potential Residual Effects 

The proposed pipeline route will parallel existing linear disturbance (i.e., pipeline rights-of-way and roads) 
for approximately 78% of its length. Minor deviations from existing linear disturbance are required to 
facilitate crossing roads or watercourses and to route around existing dispositions. The potential effects 
associated with the construction and operation of the Project on wildlife and wildlife habitat were identified 
in consultation with Aboriginal communities and by the assessment team, and are listed in Table 6.21. 

Concerns related to wildlife and wildlife habitat that were identified by Aboriginal participants during 
biophysical field studies can be found in Table 2-5 of the TK Report (Appendix 8). Mitigation measures to 
reduce the severity of the potential effects of the proposed Project on wildlife and wildlife habitat are 
provided in the EPP (Appendix 1). Key mitigation measures are summarized in Table 6.21.  

Mitigation measures (Table 6.21) were developed in accordance with NGTL standards and provincial and 
federal regulatory guidelines including, however, not limited to the following: 

• Environmental Handbook for Pipeline Construction (AENV 1988); 

• Municipal District of Greenview No. 16. Municipal Development Plan (MD of 
Greenview 2003a); 

• Petroleum Industry Activity Guidelines for Wildlife Species at Risk in the Prairie and 
Northern Region (Environment Canada 2011); and  

• Integrated Standards and Guidelines - Enhanced Approval Process (Government of 
Alberta 2013).

methods to conduct an area search for 
evidence of nesting (e.g., presence of singing

6.2.10.4 Significance Evaluation of Potential Residual Effects 

The methodology set out in Section 6.1 was adopted for the characterization and significance determination 
for potential residual adverse effects on wildlife and wildlife habitat. All assessment criteria were considered 
when determining the significance of each residual adverse effect. The most influential assessment criteria 
for wildlife and wildlife habitat are magnitude and reversibility. The determinations of significance for the 
potential residual effects on wildlife and wildlife habitat are also strongly influenced by ecological context, 
including relevant conservation, recovery, and land use planning objectives and strategies, which is 
reflected in the criteria ratings for magnitude. Qualitative significance determinations incorporate 
professional judgement, which allows for integration of all effects criteria ratings to provide relevant 
significance conclusions that are sensitive to context and facilitate decision-making (Lawrence 2007). 

There are three primary effect pathways that have potential to affect wildlife and wildlife habitat including 
changes in habitat, movement and mortality risk. The following subsections describe these effect pathways 
(e.g., cause-effect relationships), as well as the potential effects associated with accidents and 
malfunctions. Table 6.22 summarizes the characterization and significance determination of potential 
residual environmental effects of the construction and operation of the Project on wildlife and wildlife habitat.

CHARACTERIZATION OF RESIDUAL EFFECTS FOR  
EVALUATION OF SIGNIFICANCE - WILDLIFE AND WILDLIFE HABITAT 

Potential 
Residual Effect Criteria Rating Effects Characterization Rationale 

a. Changes to 
wildlife habitat 

Impact balance: 
Negative 

• The effects of Project construction may result in a reduction in 
quality and quantity of wildlife habitat, which will have an 
adverse effect on wildlife and wildlife habitat. 

Spatial boundary: 
Wildlife LSA 

• Direct habitat alteration will occur within the Project Footprint. 
Indirect changes in habitat (e.g., changes in vegetation 
communities along habitat edges; reduced use or avoidance 
of disturbance; sensory disturbance) will extend beyond the 
Footprint into the Wildlife LSA. 

Duration: Short-Term • The events causing potential effects are construction and 
operational activities (e.g., monitoring, vegetation 
management and site-specific maintenance) associated with 
the Project. 

Frequency: Periodic • The events causing potential effects (i.e., clearing of the 
Project Footprint, traffic and activity) will occur during 
construction and may occur intermittently during operations for 
monitoring, vegetation control and maintenance. 

Reversibility: Short 
to Long-Term 

• Reversibility of residual effects on wildlife habitat will vary by 
habitat type. Regeneration of disturbed aquatic, herbaceous 
and shrub-dominant habitats will occur in a much shorter 
timeframe than mature forested habitats, which will take 
decades to regenerate. Sensory disturbance associated with 
construction is reversible in the short-term upon completion of 
activities; however, some species may exhibit reduced habitat 
use within a zone of influence adjacent to the Project Footprint 
until natural vegetation has sufficiently regenerated. 
Regeneration of disturbed vegetation will begin during the 
operations phase, with the pipeline right-of-way being 
maintained with low vegetation during operations. Following 
decommissioning, native vegetation will be no longer be 
maintained at an early structural stage. Regeneration of 
vegetation at the meter station will begin following 
decommissioning of the meter station. Adverse residual 
effects on wildlife habitat are reversible in the short (upon 
completion of construction activities) to long-term (i.e., time 
required for restoration of mature forests). 

Magnitude: Low • With the implementation of the mitigation measures provided, 
the residual effect of the construction and operation of the 
Project on wildlife and wildlife habitat is concluded to be of low 
magnitude. 

Probability: High • The Project is located within wildlife habitat (e.g., forest, 
shrublands, watercourses, wetlands). 

Confidence: High • The assessment is based on a good understanding of cause-
effect relationships and data pertinent to the Project area. 

Significance: Not 
Significant  

• Although the probability of a residual effect on wildlife habitat 
is high, it is of low magnitude and reversible in the long-term 
and, therefore, is not significant. 

b. Changes to 
wildlife 
movement 

Impact balance: 
Negative 

• Altered wildlife movements to avoid construction activities or 
disturbed habitats may result in adverse effects on wildlife, 
such as displacement and potential use of suboptimal 
habitats. 

Spatial boundary: 
Wildlife LSA 

• Changes to wildlife movement patterns extend beyond the 
Project Footprint to the Wildlife LSA.

b. Changes to 
wildlife 
movement 
(cont’d) 

Duration: Short-Term • The events causing potential effects are construction and 
operational activities (e.g., monitoring, vegetation 
management and site-specific maintenance). 

Frequency: Periodic • The events causing potential effects (i.e., clearing of the 
Project Footprint, traffic and activity) will occur during 
construction and may occur intermittently during operations 
for monitoring, vegetation control and maintenance. 

Reversibility: Short 
to Long-Term 

• Changes in wildlife movement as a result of barriers or 
avoidance of construction activities and noise are reversible in 
the short-term upon completion of the construction phase. 
Changes in wildlife movement may extend into the operation 
phase for some wildlife species that exhibit avoidance of 
habitats within a zone of influence adjacent to disturbance. 
Therefore, the residual effect is considered reversible in the 
short to long-term, once disturbed vegetation within the 
Project Footprint regenerates to sufficient height and density 
to alleviate changes in wildlife movement. 

Magnitude: Low • The magnitude of residual effects of pipeline construction and 
operations on wildlife movement is considered low. In addition 
to the proposed mitigation measures, 78% of the length of the 
pipeline route parallels existing linear disturbance, which 
reduces the amount of new linear development and habitat 
fragmentation that may affect wildlife movement. The meter 
station has been cited in close proximity to an existing pipeline 
right-of-way and other development. Industrial noise from 
nearby energy development projects can be heard at the 
meter station. 

Probability: High • Some wildlife species are likely to alter movement patterns to 
avoid construction activities and disturbed habitats. Open 
trench, soil, snow and slash windrows and strung pipe may 
create barriers to wildlife movement during construction. 

Confidence: High • The assessment is based on a good understanding of 
cause-effect relationships and data pertinent to the Project 
area. 

Significance: Not 
Significant  

• Although the probability of a residual effect on wildlife 
movement is high, it is of low magnitude and reversible in the 
long-term and, therefore, is not significant. 

c. Changes to 
wildlife mortality 
risk 

Impact balance: 
Negative 

• Project construction and operation may adversely affect 
wildlife as a result of increased mortality risk. 

Spatial boundary: 
Wildlife RSA 

• The potential increase in wildlife mortality risk during 
construction may result from vehicle collisions to and from the 
work site (i.e., within the Wildlife RSA). The potential increase 
in mortality risk associated with disturbance of small 
mammals, amphibians and reptiles that may inhabit woody 
debris, litter and soil is restricted to the Footprint. 

Duration: Short-Term • The events causing potential changes in mortality risk due to 
vehicle/wildlife collisions and disturbance of occupied habitat 
are construction and operational activities (e.g., monitoring, 
vegetation management and site-specific maintenance). 

Frequency: Periodic • The events causing potential effects (i.e., clearing of the 
Project Footprint, traffic and activity) will occur during 
construction and may occur intermittently during operations 
for monitoring, vegetation control and maintenance.

Potential 
Residual Effect Criteria Rating Effects Characterization Rationale 

 c. Changes to 
wildlife mortality 
risk (cont’d) 

Reversibility: Short 
to Long-Term  

• Residual effects associated with construction activities or 
periodic maintenance events are reversible in the short-term 
upon completion of activities. The Project may affect mortality 
risk for some wildlife species as a result of predation risk 
associated with habitat edges. As a result, the residual effect 
is reversible in the short (upon completion) to long-term, once 
disturbed vegetation within the Project Footprint has 
sufficiently regenerated to alleviate edge effects. 

Magnitude: Low  • Implementation of the mitigation measures provided will 
effectively reduce the magnitude of residual effects on wildlife 
mortality during construction to low. Given the location of the 
Project adjacent to existing disturbance features, the Project’s 
residual effect on mortality risk associated with habitat edges 
is expected to be low. 

Probability: High • Due to the nature of Project construction activities, there is a 
high potential for increased risk of wildlife mortality. Effective 
mitigation is expected to reduce the increased risk of wildlife 
mortality. 

Confidence: 
Moderate 

• The assessment is based on a good understanding of 
cause-effect relationships and data pertinent to the Project 
area. There is some uncertainty associated with the 
interaction of the Project with amphibians during terrestrial life 
stages, however this uncertainty can be adequately managed 
through implementation of appropriate mitigation.  

Significance: Not 
Significant  

• Although the probability of a residual effect on wildlife 
mortality risk is high, it is of low magnitude and reversible in 
the long-term and, therefore, is not significant. 

d. Effects of 
accidents and 
malfunctions on 
wildlife 

Impact balance: 
Negative 

• In the event of an accident or malfunction, adverse effects on 
wildlife and/or wildlife habitat may occur. 

Spatial boundary: 
Wildlife RSA 

• Accidents and malfunctions are typically confined to the 
disturbed portions of the Project Footprint. In the unlikely 
event of a large spill, or fire caused by a pipeline failure and 
gas release, adverse residual effects may extend beyond the 
Project Footprint into the Wildlife LSA or Wildlife RSA. 

Duration: Immediate 
to short-term 

• The event causing potential increased mortality risk or habitat 
alteration, such as a spill or a fire, is expected to be generally 
less than or equal to two days (immediate) and are not 
expected to occur for longer than one year (short-term). 

Frequency: 
Accidental 

• Prevention measures are expected to effectively avoid the 
occurrence of accidents and malfunctions such that the 
frequency of such events would occur rarely, if at all. 

Reversibility: Short 
to Long-Term 

• Most spills (e.g., terrestrial spot spills) or fires are likely to be 
cleaned up and remediated within days (short-term), however, 
larger spills that might occur in an aquatic environment or 
near vegetation that will require clearing to facilitate clean-up 
are reversible in the long-term. 

Magnitude: Low to 
High 

• Most accidents and malfunctions are expected to be small, 
restricted to the Project Footprint, and readily cleaned up, 
such that there are little or no measureable effects on wildlife 
and wildlife habitat. However, a large spill that cannot be 
completely cleaned up (e.g., into a waterbody) or a fire that 
spreads into the Wildlife LSA or beyond could be of high 
magnitude.

d. Effects of 
accidents and 
malfunctions on 
wildlife (cont’d) 

Probability: Low • Preventative measures (e.g., safety training, appropriate 
construction methods and preventative maintenance) are 
expected to effectively reduce the likelihood of accidents and 
malfunctions. 

Confidence: 
Moderate 

• Based on the professional experience of the assessment 
team. 

Significance: Not 
Significant  

• The probability of a residual effect due to an accident or 
malfunction is low, is of low to high magnitude and reversible 
in the short to long-term and, therefore, is not significant. 

e. Combined 
effects on 
wildlife and 
wildlife habitat 

Impact balance: 
Negative 

• Some wildlife are likely to experience adverse residual effects 
of the Project as a result of changes in habitat, movement and 
mortality risk. 

Spatial boundary: 
Wildlife RSA 

• The combined effects on wildlife habitat may extend into the 
Wildlife RSA. 

Duration: Short-Term • The events causing combined effects on wildlife and wildlife 
habitat are construction and operational activities 
(e.g., monitoring, vegetation management and site-specific 
maintenance). 

Frequency: Periodic • The events causing combined effects on wildlife and wildlife 
habitat (i.e., clearing of the Project Footprint, traffic and 
activity) will occur during construction and may occur 
intermittently during operations for monitoring, vegetation 
control and maintenance. 

Reversibility: Long-
Term 

• The reversibility of combined Project effects on wildlife 
(i.e., change in habitat, movement and mortality risk) is 
constrained by the long-term timeline for reclamation of treed 
habitats. 

Magnitude: Low • Given the scope, location and routing of the Project, and with 
implementation of the mitigation measures provided, the 
combined residual effect on wildlife and wildlife habitat is 
concluded to be of low magnitude. 

Probability: High • It is likely that some wildlife species will experience residual 
effects of the Project in combination (i.e., combined effects 
associated with changes to wildlife habitat, wildlife movement 
and wildlife mortality risk). 

Confidence: 
Moderate 

• The assessment is based on good understanding of cause-
effect relationships using data pertinent to the Project area. 
Uncertainty associated with mortality risk for some wildlife 
reduces the confidence rating to moderate. 

Significance: Not 
Significant  

• Although the probability of a residual effect on wildlife and 
wildlife habitat is high, it is of low magnitude and reversible in 
the long-term and, therefore, is not significant. 

Note: Significant Residual Environmental Effect: A high probability of occurrence of a permanent or long-term 
residual effect of high magnitude that cannot be technically or economically mitigated. 

 

Changes to Wildlife Habitat 
Changes in wildlife habitat will result from construction and operation of the Project. Clearing of vegetation, 
strippings salvage and grading activities will result in direct habitat loss or alteration. Indirect habitat 
alteration occurs when habitat is available, however, the quality or effectiveness of the habitat is changed 
such that wildlife avoid the habitat or reduce their use of it. Reduced habitat effectiveness can occur as a 
result of fragmentation, creation of edges, or sensory disturbance (e.g., noise, artificial light, proximity to 
facilities and infrastructure, human activity and traffic). Habitat fragmentation can cause habitat to become

unsuitable for species with large territories or home ranges (i.e., patch sizes become too small), alter 
predator-prey dynamics and allow for increased invasive or parasitic species abundance (e.g., cowbird 
parasitism of songbird nests near forest edges). Changes in habitat suitability may also result from changes 
in vegetation communities due to increased light penetration at clearing edges, or from changes in water 
quality (e.g., siltation, deposition of airborne contaminants). Habitat loss and reduced habitat effectiveness 
can cause displacement of wildlife, and potentially result in use of less suitable habitat, reduced foraging 
ability (Bird et al. 2004), increased energy expenditure (Jalkotzy et al. 1997) and lower reproductive success 
(Habib et al. 2007). 

Harper et al. (2001) identifies pipeline projects as having an adverse effect on vegetation and, therefore, 
wildlife habitat, due to the removal or modification of the pre-construction vegetation on the Footprint and 
subsequent change in ecosystem dynamics (i.e., changes in microclimate, ground cover, soil compaction). 
The adverse habitat effects for most wildlife species are considered minor unless a substantial portion or 
critical element of the habitat is rendered unsuitable by the development (Harper et al. 2001). 

The area of new habitat disturbance is reduced through the alignment of the pipeline route adjacent to 
existing disturbances to the extent practical, and through shared workspace where pipeline rights-of-way 
are paralleled. Approximately 78% of the pipeline route parallels existing linear disturbance (i.e., existing 
pipeline rights-of-way and roads). Paralleling existing linear disturbances meets provincial and industry 
guidelines relating to pipeline routing (Government of Alberta 2013). The Project Footprint is located on 
approximately 65.3 ha (49%) of previously cleared land (e.g., existing cutlines, pipeline rights-of-way and 
roads). Construction of the Project will result in approximately 48.0 ha and 2.6 ha of new clearing of forested 
and wetland areas, respectively. By paralleling existing disturbances, the fragmentation and isolation of 
habitat patches are reduced. In addition, minimal surface disturbance procedures will be used to reduce 
disturbance along the right-of-way. Salvage of strippings will only be conducted where grading is required. 
In segments of the pipeline route where strippings salvage is not conducted (i.e., flat and level terrain within 
upland forest, mineral wetlands and peatlands), disturbance will be limited to the trench line, with the intent 
to leave the vegetated root mat and seedbed intact on the remainder of the right-of-way. In addition, 
grubbing will be reduced near watercourses, muskeg, and other wet areas and to facilitate the restoration 
of shrub communities. Appropriate reclamation measures will be applied to disturbed areas along the 
pipeline route as outlined in Table 6.21.  

In addition to clearing of natural vegetation communities, the pipeline has the potential to alter aquatic 
habitat by changing wetland habitat function or water quality. Amphibians are particularly sensitive to 
changes in water quality or increased siltation that may result from construction in and adjacent to wetlands. 
In peatlands, tree removal during construction and operation often results in an increased soil moisture 
regime altering the wetland type. Commonly, treed bogs and fens revert to sedge-dominant marshes due 
to the increased groundwater availability that had previously been lower due to tree uptake. The most 
important considerations for limiting disturbances to hydrologic functions are ensuring that pre-construction 
elevations and contours are achieved (Gartman 1991), and ensuring that there will be no unnatural 
impedance to water flow. Conducting construction activities during a period with relatively low water 
levels/frozen ground conditions and re-establishing pre-construction contours within the wetland boundary 
during reclamation are expected to reduce the effects of construction on water quality due to siltation and 
wetland function, respectively. Additional measures to reduce water quality effects in wetlands and wetland 
habitat function are discussed in Sections 6.2.3 and 6.2.8, and Tables 6.7 and 6.17, respectively.  

Habitat effectiveness may be affected by noise, light and activity associated with Project construction and 
operation (e.g., maintenance activities). Sensory effects on wildlife can potentially include habitat loss or 
reduced habitat effectiveness through avoidance, increased energy expenditure, changes in normal 
behaviours (e.g., feeding) and impaired communication between individuals. For example, moose have 
been documented to avoid pipeline rights-of-way during construction periods (Morgantini 1982 and 1984 in 
Jalkotzy et al. 1997) and reduce their use of or avoid other linear features such as roads, trails and seismic 
lines (Rolley and Keith 1980, Ferguson and Keith 1982, Collister et al. 2003). Wasser et al. (2011) reported 
moose avoided linear features with no or unknown levels of human use and areas near primary roads, 
however, avoidance effects were not apparent for moose beyond several hundred metres of exploration 
roads. Different species and even individuals of a given species are expected to respond differently to 
sensory disturbances. Various factors affect an animal’s response to sensory disturbances, such as noise

level, frequency distribution, duration, number of events, rate of onset, level of existing ambient noise, time 
of year or day, animal activity and location, animal age and gender.  

The residual effect of the Project on wildlife habitat is reduced by reducing the area of disturbance (i.e., by 
routing adjacent to existing disturbances, utilization of adjacent rights-of-way for workspace) and 
reclamation of the Footprint. Additional mitigation listed in Table 6.21 and the EPP (Appendix 1) will reduce 
the residual effects of the Project on habitat effectiveness. Scheduling of construction activities outside of 
the migratory bird nesting period will avoid disturbance of breeding birds. With mitigation, the residual effect 
of the Project on wildlife habitat is expected to be of low magnitude (Table 6.22, point [a]).  

Changes to Wildlife Movement  
Wildlife movement patterns vary between species, with species-specific attributes such as size and life 
stage, and other factors such as time of day and season. Most species will alter their movement to avoid 
construction areas (see wildlife habitat discussion above), however, some species may be less affected by 
human activity and noise during construction, and may use established trails or movement patterns.  

Changes in movement patterns in the vicinity of the meter station and during operation of the pipeline may 
occur in the areas where there are minor deviations from the existing linear corridor. In some cases, linear 
developments have been shown to block, delay or deflect ungulate movements, potentially restricting or 
reducing access to some parts of their range (Harper et al. 2001). Changes in movement patterns during 
operation may also occur where the pipeline route is adjacent to existing linear corridors, since the 
increased corridor width may cause an incremental barrier effect for some wildlife species. Studies on small 
mammal movements in the boreal forest have concluded that pipeline rights-of-way may act as barriers or 
filters to movement of flying squirrels, red squirrels and marten (Marklevitz 2003).  

Forest gaps have been shown to affect movements of forest birds (Bayne et al. 2005, Fleming and 
Schmiegelow 2002, Desrochers and Hannon 1997). Narrow corridors may act as barriers or filters to boreal 
forest birds, although they do not appear to create large zones of influence with reduced bird use 
(Bayne et al. 2005). Research conducted by Fleming and Schmiegelow (2002) on bird willingness to cross 
varying widths of pipeline rights-of-way (15-16 m, 22-24 m, 32-34 m, and >50 m) in the boreal forest of 
Alberta was inconclusive due to low sample sizes. However, several species did show an unwillingness to 
cross even narrow corridors. The same study found that bird community structure was affected by the 
presence of a right-of-way and nests adjacent to a narrow right-of-way experienced lower predation rates 
compared to a wider right-of-way. Desrochers and Hannon (1997) found that gaps less than 30 m in width 
had little effect on bird movements, though wider gaps constrained movement for specific species. That 
study also found forested detours strongly facilitated movements around gaps. St. Clair et al. (1998) 
reported that birds use forested detours to move across gaps where they are available. Habitat 
fragmentation results when barriers to movement cause functional separation of habitats into smaller, 
isolated habitat patches (Andrén 1994, Jalkotzy et al. 1997). 

Changes in movement patterns can also occur since some wildlife species may be attracted to 
rights-of-way. For example, linear disturbances may provide a travel route for predators such as wolves 
and bears during operation. Several studies have found that linear corridors are attractive to wolves as 
easy travel routes (Thurber et al. 1994, Stuart-Smith et al. 1997, James 1999). Increased forage availability 
for some wildlife species is expected once vegetation communities regenerate to early seral vegetation 
(e.g., grasses/shrubs and potential for greater berry productivity at clearing edges), which may attract some 
wildlife to the right-of-way, thereby changing their normal movement patterns.  

Barriers to wildlife movement during construction are mitigated by leaving gaps in snow, soil, slash and 
set-up pipe. Changes in wildlife movement patterns during operation are mitigated by paralleling existing 
corridors to the extent practical, reducing the width of new disturbance by utilising workspace on adjacent 
corridors, and encouraging regeneration of native species (e.g., using native seed mixes without legumes, 
allowing natural regeneration, and limiting vegetation control along the proposed right-of-way during 
operation to the extent practical). Mitigation measures for provision of cover across the proposed 
right-of-way at select locations (e.g., reclamation of riparian areas along watercourse crossings) will assist 
in maintaining movements, dispersal and habitat contiguity for many wildlife species (Harper et al. 2001). 
The effect of construction on changes in movement patterns in the vicinity of the meter station is reduced 
given that it has been sited in close proximity to an existing pipeline right-of-way and other development.

Industrial noise from nearby energy development projects can be heard at the meter station. With mitigation, 
the residual effect of the construction of the Project on wildlife movement is expected to be of low magnitude 
(Table 6.22, point [b]).  

Change in Wildlife Mortality Risk 
The level of mortality risk that will occur due to Project construction activities will depend on the species 
guild and can be mitigated in part by scheduling. Clearing and constructing outside the migratory bird 
breeding season will prevent mortality of nesting birds. Grubbing, strippings salvage and grading activities 
may affect small mammals, amphibians and reptiles that inhabit woody debris, litter and soil. Although 
multi-passenger vehicles will be used to transport crews to and from the job site where practical and vehicle 
speed will be limited on the roads accessing the Project, as well as on the construction right-of-way, a slight 
increase in potential for vehicle/wildlife collisions will occur during the construction period and, to a lesser 
extent, during operations. The mitigation measures (Table 6.21) to be implemented during construction to 
reduce the potential for wildlife mortality are expected to reduce the potential for wildlife mortality associated 
with the construction of the pipeline. Access control measures (e.g., rollback) will also reduce potential 
increased wildlife mortality risk associated with legal and illegal hunting and trapping. 

Some ungulates such as moose may be attracted to linear features as forage availability increases once 
vegetation communities regenerate to early seral vegetation. Moose have been shown to select habitat 
based on forage over security, often preferring early seral, shrub dominated habitats (Wasser et al. 2011) 
with lower densities of coniferous tree cover (Schwartz and Franzmann 1991, Rempel et al. 1997, 
Hebblewhite et al. 2010). Deer are also known to be attracted to recently cleared linear disturbances (Lyon 
and Jensen 1980) given the increased production of forage (Wallmo et al. 1972). Deer easily habituate to 
disturbance corridors, especially those with low human activity (Scott-Brown 1984). Wasser et al. (2011) 
found a positive selection by wolves for linear features and habitat with high suitability for deer. Mitigation 
measures to reduce line-of-sight along the proposed pipeline route (e.g., alignment of the pipeline route to 
include frequent bends, removing and reclaiming all temporary access created for the Project, recontouring 
to pre-construction conditions and seeding accordingly). With mitigation, the residual effect of the Project 
on wildlife mortality risk is expected to be of low magnitude (Table 6.22, point [c]). 

Effects of Accidents and Malfunctions on Wildlife  
Wildlife mortality or injury and reduced habitat quality (i.e., water quality and vegetation alteration) could 
occur in the event of a spill or fire during construction or operations. Toxic substances that are accidentally 
released or are not properly contained can create exposure pathways for wildlife, and vegetation. The scale 
of the effect is dependent on the exposure pathway (e.g., ingestion from contaminated vegetation, mineral 
soil or water; inhalation of contaminated air), as well as the size, type and location of spill.  

Several contingency plans and emergency response plans will be in place to direct response measures in 
the event there is a spill or hazardous substance release (Section 6.2.20 Accidents and Malfunctions). 
Depending on the severity and location, and the wildlife species affected, the magnitude of the impact of 
an accident or malfunction on wildlife either directly or through environmental pathways (e.g., contaminated 
water) could be high. With implementation of prevention measures, the probability of wildlife mortality or 
injury and reduced habitat quality due to an accident or malfunction is low (Table 6.22, point [d]).  

Combined Effects on Wildlife and Wildlife Habitat 
The evaluation of combined effects on wildlife considers all of the potential residual effects evaluated in 
Table 6.22 (points [a] through [d]) that are likely to occur as a result of the construction and operation of the 
Project, and that could act in combination on wildlife in the Wildlife RSA. Effects that are considered unlikely 
(e.g., effects of accidents and malfunctions on wildlife) are not included in the combined effects analysis. 
The residual effects on wildlife and wildlife habitat are expected to act in combination differently during the 
construction and operation phases of the Project. These mechanisms are described in the previous 
subsections. For example, changes in movement during construction are mostly likely to occur as a result 
of barriers, activity and noise, whereas the early seral habitat associated with the cleared Project Footprint 
is likely the primary mechanism changing movement patterns during operation (e.g., wide openings filter 
habitat for some species).

Combined residual effects associated with changes to wildlife habitat, wildlife movement and wildlife 
mortality risk will extend over the construction phase and into the operation phase (i.e., reversible in the 
long-term). Individually, the magnitude of the residual effects is low. Given the scope, location and routing 
of the Project, and with implementation of the mitigation measures provided, the combined residual effect 
on wildlife and wildlife habitat is concluded to be of low magnitude (Table 6.22, point [e]). 

6.2.10.5 Summary 

As identified in Table 6.22, there are no situations where there is a high probability of occurrence of a 
permanent or long-term residual environmental effect on wildlife and wildlife habitat of high magnitude that 
cannot be technically mitigated. Consequently, it is concluded that the residual environmental effects of 
Project construction and operation on wildlife and wildlife habitat will be not significant. 

6.2.11 Species at Risk 

6.2.11.1 Spatial Boundaries 

The spatial boundaries identified in Sections 6.2.10.1, 6.2.7.1 and 6.2.9.1 were also used in the effects 
assessment for species at risk, as applicable. 

6.2.11.2 Ecological Context 

Bull trout are listed by COSEWIC as Special Concern (COSEWIC 2014) and may be present in the 
watershed, however, they are not known to occur within the ZOI of the proposed watercourse crossings. 
There are other sportfish species documented within Bald Mountain Creek, however, no sportfish species 
or any federally or provincially listed species were captured or observed during the February 2014 or 
May 2014 assessment in any of the proposed watercourse crossing locations (Appendix 3).  

No vegetation species with special conservation status (i.e., listed as Endangered, Threatened or Special 
Concern) under SARA or COSEWIC are known to occur in the Central Mixedwood, Lower Foothills and 
Upper Foothills Natural Subregions (ACIMS 2014a, 2014a). One plant species listed as Endangered under 
SARA and COSEWIC (i.e., a species facing imminent extirpation or extinction), whitebark pine (Pinus 
albicaulis), is known to occur in the Upper Foothills Natural Subregion (ACIMS 2014a). Based on the known 
range, occurrences and habitat requirements of whitebark pine (Moss 1983, Langor 2007), this plant 
species is not expected to occur along the proposed route. No occurrences of rare vegetation with a SARA 
or COSEWIC designation have been previously recorded within 10 km of the Project (ACIMS 2014b). 

Federally listed wildlife species (i.e., COSEWIC or SARA Schedule 1 designation) identified as having 
potential to occur in the vicinity of the Project (based on known ranges and preferred habitat availability) 
include the following: grizzly bear; little brown myotis; northern myotis; wolverine; bank swallow; barn 
swallow; Canada warbler; common nighthawk; horned grebe; olive-sided flycatcher; rusty blackbird; 
short-eared owl; yellow rail and western toad.  

Three SARA Schedule 1 and/or COSEWIC species occurrence records were identified in the AESRD 
FWMIS online database as being observed within 1 km of the pipeline route, including American badger, 
grizzly bear and Canada warbler (AESRD 2014b). The American badger occurrences are considered 
extralimital given that the Project is outside of the typical range for this species (COSEWIC 2012a, 
Scobie 2002). Two SARA Schedule 1 and/or COSEWIC species occurrence records were observed within 
1 km of the meter station, including: grizzly bear and western toad. 

Grizzly bear and western toad were the only species with federal conservation status (i.e., SARA, 
COSEWIC) detected during previous wildlife field work on the existing Cutbank River Lateral Loop (TERA 
Environmental Consultants 2010d). No species at risk, or their sign, were observed during the winter 
tracking surveys conducted in February 2014. During the June 2014 field work, the following SARA 
Schedule 1 and/or COSEWIC species, or their sign, were observed in the vicinity of the proposed pipeline 
route: grizzly bear, peregrine falcon and western toad. The peregrine falcon observed near KP 30 is 
considered extralimital given that the Project is outside of the typical range for this species (AESRD 2014a, 
COSEWIC 2007a). There are no potential breeding areas for peregrine falcon (i.e., cliffs) along the pipeline 
route or at the meter station.

In order to focus the assessment of Project effects on wildlife species at risk, indicators were selected for 
detailed analysis. Wildlife indicators were selected based on their potential to interact with and be adversely 
affected by the Project. Refer to Table 6.23 for additional information regarding indicator species selection. 

Species that use open habitats for hunting or nesting including barn swallow, common nighthawk and 
short-eared owl were not assessed because Project construction will occur during winter (i.e., effects on 
migratory bird movement and mortality risk are unlikely) and forest clearing will create open habitats, which 
may increase available habitat for these species. Therefore, there is a low potential for the Project to have 
an adverse interaction with these species at risk, and they were scoped out of the assessment. 

Bank swallow was not assessed because Project construction will occur during winter (i.e., effects on 
movement and mortality risk are unlikely), no bank swallows were observed during the June 2014 field 
work, and the marginal nesting habitat within proposed temporary workspace at the Bald Mountain Creek 
near KP 4.7 will be avoided by the planned HDD (i.e., an effect on bank swallow habitat is unlikely). No 
adverse interactions with this species is expected. 

The wildlife species at risk indicators and selection rationale are presented in Table 6.23. 

TABLE 6.23 
 

RATIONALE FOR WILDLIFE SPECIES AT RISK INDICATOR SELECTION 

Indicator Selection Rationale 
grizzly bear Potential for Project interaction (proposed meter station and access road are located within 

the Secondary Grizzly Bear Zone); conservation status; management and cultural 
importance; environmental indicator (sensitive to disturbance); indicative of potential effects 
on wolverine (i.e., both species have large home ranges and use a wide range of habitat 
types; forest clearing does not necessarily negatively affect habitat for either species, 
although human presence and activities can alter behavior patterns; risk of mortality for both 
species is increased when new access is created). 

bats  Potential for Project interaction (e.g., forest clearing); group includes multiple species with 
conservation status of concern (little brown myotis, northern myotis); environmental indicator 
(sensitive to change). 

forest birds  Potential for Project interaction; conservation status; representative species group for 
passerines; representative of species that rely on mature upland forest habitat and 
regenerating forests (Canada warbler) and species that rely on open forest or edge habitats 
(olive-sided flycatcher). 

wetland birds Three wetland bird species at risk are assessed in detail as part of this group, which are 
representative of different wetland habitat types along the proposed route: horned grebe 
(Special Concern by COSEWIC); rusty blackbird (Special Concern on Schedule 1 of SARA 
and by COSEWIC) and yellow rail (Special Concern on Schedule 1 of SARA and by 
COSEWIC). 

western toad Potential for Project interaction; conservation status; environmental indicator (sensitive to 
environmental change); indicative of potential effects on amphibian species requiring 
connectivity between terrestrial habitats and open water breeding habitat. 

 

6.2.11.3 Potential Effects, Mitigation Measures and Potential Residual Effects 

Three effect pathways are identified as the primary mechanism for the Project to affect wildlife species at 
risk: changes in habitat; changes in movement; and changes in mortality risk (Table 6.23). 

There were no potential effects identified relating to the alteration of riparian habitat for fish species at risk, 
nor the loss or alteration of vegetation species at risk since the Project Footprint is not located within the 
range and habitat of any SARA Schedule 1 or COSEWIC-listed fish or vegetation species. Consequently, 
no evaluation of significance is required for potential effects on vegetation or fish species at risk. Mitigation 
measures for fish species of concern and potential rare vegetation populations are provided in Table 6.15 
and Table 6.19, respectively.

Mitigation measures to reduce the potential effects of the Project on wildlife species at risk are summarized 
in Table 6.24 and were developed in accordance with NGTL standards and industry and provincial 
regulatory guidelines including AENV (1988), Environment Canada (2011) and Government of Alberta 
(2013a). The results of field surveys are used to inform the development of mitigation to reduce the potential 
residual effects of the Project on wildlife species at risk.

6.2.11.4 Significance Evaluation of Potential Residual Effects 

As noted in Section 6.2.11.3, there are three primary effect pathways that have potential to affect wildlife 
species at risk: changes in habitat, movement and mortality risk. The following subsections describe these 
effect pathways (e.g., cause-effect relationships). The combined suite of potential adverse effects of the 
Project on habitat, movement and mortality risk constitute the potential residual effect for the species at risk 
indicators (Table 6.23). Assessing combined residual effects was determined to be the most appropriate 
method of evaluating potential adverse effects on the wildlife species at risk indicators because wildlife 
populations and individuals may experience influences of all three effect pathways. 

Potential effects on wildlife and wildlife habitat related to accidents and malfunctions are assessed in 
Section 6.2.20, which also applies to wildlife species at risk. Table 6.25 summarizes the significance 
evaluation of potential residual environmental effects of the construction and operation of the Project on 
wildlife species at risk.  

The qualitative assessment method was adopted for the characterization and significance determination of 
residual adverse effects on wildlife species at risk. All assessment criteria were considered when 
determining the significance of each residual adverse effect. The most influential assessment criteria for 
wildlife and wildlife habitat are magnitude and reversibility. Quantitative analyses were completed to inform 
the characterization of the magnitude of residual effects.

Effect Criteria Rating Effects Characterization Rationale 

a. Combined Project 
effects on grizzly 
bear resulting from 
changes in habitat, 
movement and 
mortality risk 

Impact balance: 
Negative 

• Changes in habitat, movement and mortality risk as a result 
of the Project have potential to adversely affect grizzly bear. 

Spatial boundary: 
Wildlife RSA 

• Habitat changes (e.g., clearing) and alteration of movement 
(e.g., avoidance of construction) will be limited to the Wildlife 
LSA; however, changes in mortality risk (e.g., traffic) are 
assessed at the regional scale. 

Duration: Short-
Term 

• The events causing potential effects are construction and 
operation activities (e.g., monitoring, vegetation management 
and site-specific maintenance). 

Frequency: 
Periodic 

• The events causing potential effects (i.e., clearing of the 
Project Footprint, traffic and activity) will occur during 
construction and may occur intermittently during operations 
for monitoring, vegetation control and maintenance. 

Reversibility: 
Long-Term 

• Potential effects are reversible in the long-term, once native 
vegetation regenerates over the Project Footprint, following 
decommissioning of the meter station.  

Magnitude: Low • The mitigation measures provided in Table 6.24 are 
consistent with regulatory guidelines, and will reduce the 
potential adverse effects from the Project on grizzly bear. 
The residual effect of the Project on grizzly bear will be low in 
magnitude given that only the meter station components are 
located within the Secondary Grizzly Bear Zone, with a 
portion of the proposed access road located within existing 
pipeline rights-of-way (approximately 80 m) and the 
remainder of the site is located in an area of relatively 
intensive land use. Therefore, the amount of new access that 
will be created within the Secondary Grizzly Bear Zone is 
negligible. The magnitude of the combined residual effect on 
grizzly bear habitat, movement and mortality risk is 
concluded to be low. 

Probability: High • The meter station will alter habitat and cause sensory 
disturbance within the Secondary Grizzly Bear Zone. 

Confidence: High • The assessment is based on a good understanding of cause-
effect relationships and data pertinent to the Project area. 

Significance: Not 
Significant  

• Although the probability of a residual effect on grizzly bear is 
high, it is of low magnitude and reversible in the long-term 
and, therefore, is not significant. 

b. Change in habitat 
for bats 

Impact balance: 
Negative 

• Project construction and operation has the potential to 
adversely affect bats as a result of changes in habitat. 

Spatial boundary: 
Wildlife RSA 

• Changes to habitat may extend beyond the cleared 
construction footprint (Project Footprint) into the Wildlife LSA 
(e.g., edge effects or sensory disturbances). 

Duration: 
Short-Term 

• The events causing potential effects are construction and 
operational activities (e.g., monitoring, vegetation 
management and site-specific maintenance). 

Frequency: 
Periodic 

• Events causing potential effects (i.e., vegetation removal 
during construction or site-specific maintenance events; 
vegetation control during operation) will occur intermittently 
however, may occur repeatedly.

Potential Residual 
Effect Criteria Rating Effects Characterization Rationale 

b. Change in habitat 
for bats 

Reversibility: 
Long-Term 

• Given the winter construction schedule and lack of habitat 
features that would potentially support hibernation habitat for 
bats, the potential interaction of the Project with bats is 
limited to habitat loss as a result of clearing tree-roosting 
habitat. Regeneration of forest vegetation will begin during 
the operations phase over much of the Project Footprint, with 
the exception of portions of the proposed pipeline right-of-
way that will be maintained with low vegetation for 
maintenance and operation. Restoration of forested habitat 
to mature or late seral stages will take decades 
(i.e., long-term). 

Magnitude: Low • Direct habitat disturbance associated with clearing mature 
and old forests is likely the primary mechanism by which the 
Project may adversely affect bats. Given that the proposed 
route is in an area of relatively intensive resource use, the 
extent of habitat alteration resulting from the Project will be 
reduced by utilizing shared workspace and narrowing the 
Footprint in riparian areas, construction will occur during 
winter (avoiding disruption of bats), and the Footprint will be 
reclaimed to natural vegetation communities, the residual 
effect of the Project on bats is concluded to be low. 

Probability: High • The Project will affect forests, edge and open habitats that 
may be used by bats for roosting or foraging. 

Confidence: 
Moderate 

• The assessment is based on a reasonable understanding of 
cause-effect relationships and data from outside the Project 
area. 

Significance: Not 
Significant  

• Although the probability of a residual effect on bat is high, the 
magnitude is low and it is reversible in the long-term and, 
therefore, is not significant. 

c. Combined Project 
effects on forest 
birds resulting from 
changes in habitat, 
movement and 
mortality risk 

Impact balance: 
Negative 

• Project construction and operation has potential to adversely 
affect forest birds as a result of changes in habitat, 
movement and mortality risk. 

Spatial boundary: 
Wildlife LSA 

• Changes to habitat, movement and mortality risk may extend 
beyond the cleared construction footprint (Project Footprint) 
into the Wildlife LSA (e.g., edge effects or sensory 
disturbances). 

Duration: 
Short--Term 

• The events causing potential effects are construction and 
operational activities (e.g., monitoring, vegetation 
management and site-specific maintenance). 

Frequency: 
Periodic 

• Events causing potential effects (i.e., vegetation removal 
during construction or site-specific maintenance events; 
vegetation control during operation) will occur intermittently 
however, may occur repeatedly. 

Reversibility: 
Long-Term 

• Regeneration of forest vegetation will begin during the 
operations phase over much of the Project Footprint, with the 
exception of portions of the pipeline right-of-way that will be 
maintained with low vegetation for maintenance and 
operation as well as the fenced and gravelled areas at the 
meter station. Restoration of forested habitat to mature or 
late seral stages will take decades. The reversibility of all 
three effects mechanisms (i.e., change in habitat, movement 
and mortality risk) combined is long-term.

(cont’d) 

Magnitude: Low  • Given that the area of habitat alteration is reduced by routing 
the pipeline along existing linear corridors for 78% of its 
length, and with the implementation of the planned mitigation 
measures (including scheduling clearing outside of the 
migratory bird nesting period, reducing the area of 
disturbance by utilizing shared workspace and narrowing the 
Footprint in riparian areas, and reclamation of the Footprint 
through natural recovery or seeding), the residual effect of 
the Project on forest birds is concluded to be low magnitude.

warbler and olive-sided flycatcher.

• Although the probability of a residual effect on forest birds is 
high, it is of low magnitude and reversible in the long-term

Grizzly Bear 

Change in Habitat  
The meter station (Figure 1.2) is located within a provincially identified Secondary Grizzly Bear Zone 
(AESRD 2014a). The desired outcome of a Grizzly Bear Zone is to reduce all sources of human caused 
mortality, reduce human bear conflicts, avoid development within key habitats (local and landscape scales) 
during key seasons and avoid development of grizzly bear attractants (Government of Alberta 2013). 
Habitat effects on grizzly bears in the forested regions of Alberta are related to alteration and increased 
human access more than permanent habitat loss (ASRD and Alberta Conservation Association 
[ACA] 2010). The altered habitat in cleared areas can provide high-quality summer and fall forage, however, 
may lead to increased mortality and population sinks (Nielsen 2005 in ASRD and ACA 2010). Project 
construction will result in alteration of approximately 0.6 ha of forest habitat at the meter station site in the

 Page 6-115  

 
 

Secondary Grizzly Bear Zone. A portion of the meter station (30% or 0.3 ha) has been sited within an 
existing cleared area. 

The pipeline route is located outside of the Secondary Grizzly Bear Zone (AESRD 2014a), but grizzly bears 
may occur in low densities outside of the provincially identified zone. Grizzly bear sign (tracks, scat) were 
observed near KP 5.0 at Bald Mountain Creek and on an existing right-of-way in regenerating mixedwood 
forest (i.e., trembling aspen and white spruce) near KP 27.9 during the June 2014 field work. The study of 
collared grizzly bears demonstrated that grizzlies use pipeline rights-of-way and other linear disturbances 
(e.g., roads and seismic lines) more than would be expected based on habitat availability 
(McKay et al. 2013). The study found that bears use pipeline rights-of-way for foraging and for travel. Anting 
was the primary foraging activity of grizzly bears on pipeline rights-of-way, particularly during the summer 
months (July and August), while herbaceous foraging, root digging sites and berry feeding sites were 
relatively common, and evidence of carnivory (e.g., moose kill) was uncommon (McKay et al. 2013). 

Many mammal species are sensitive to human disturbance, and exhibit reduced use or avoidance of habitat 
in proximity to certain disturbance types (i.e., zone of influence). This is referred to as a reduction in habitat 
effectiveness. Disturbance from anthropogenic noise created by roads has been found to have a negative 
effect on habitat use by grizzly bears, reducing habitat occupancy up to 500 m from active roads 
(Mace et al. 1996). In some situations, bears may forage close to roads or other human developments to 
avoid encounters with other bears. Female bears with cubs, in particular, may exhibit this behaviour to 
avoid conflict with male bears (Herrero et al. 2005). A reduction in habitat effectiveness for grizzly bears 
associated with construction is expected to be limited to the construction period (i.e., short-term). Limiting 
vegetation control during operation and reclaiming the right-of-way following the operations phase will 
reduce the potential effects related to changes in habitat for grizzly bears. 

Change in Movement 
Changes in movement patterns may occur in the vicinity of the meter station during operations. In addition, 
changes in movement patterns may occur along the pipeline route since grizzly bears may be attracted to 
the pipeline right-of-way. The Footprint will create increased forage availability once vegetation 
communities regenerate to early seral vegetation after reclamation (e.g., potential for greater berry 
productivity at clearing edges), which may attract grizzly bears to the right-of-way, thereby changing their 
normal movement patterns. Rights-of-way may also provide travel routes for grizzly bears. 
Mckay et al. (2013) found that collared grizzly bears tend to move faster on pipeline rights-of-way. 

Change in Mortality Risk 
Human-caused mortality associated with expanding road access and habitat alteration has been identified 
as the primary limiting factor for grizzly bears in Alberta (ASRD and ACA 2010). Access density thresholds 
related to grizzly bear mortality are discussed further in Section 7.2.8. The proposed meter station access 
road within the Secondary Grizzly Bear Zone is 263 m in length, and 46 m of that (88%) is located within 
existing disturbance (i.e., existing pipeline right-of-way) or is parallel to NGTL’s recently approved Musreau 
Cutbank Expansion Project and the proposed meter station. Only 31 m (12%) of the proposed access road 
is not parallel to existing or reasonably foreseeable development. The residual effect of the Project on 
grizzly bear will be low in magnitude given that only the meter station (including associated pipeline tie-in, 
valve site, and access road) (Figure 1.2) is located within the Secondary Grizzly Bear Zone, and the 
proposed access road is in an area of relatively intensive land use. Therefore, the amount of new access 
that will be created is negligible (Table 6.25, point [a]). 

Bats 
The assessment of potential residual effects of the Project on wildlife species at risk determined that, with 
implementation of mitigation including winter construction, there is low potential for the Project to have 
adverse residual effects on movement and mortality risk for bats. Bats have been shown to use linear 
landscape features for movement, since linear features act as navigational references and flight corridors 
for some bat species (Hein et al. 2009, Verboom and Huitema 1997). There are also no habitat features 
along the proposed route that are capable of supporting hibernating bats and given the winter construction 
schedule, mortality risk for bats associated with disruption of occupied habitat (e.g., tree roosts) is avoided.

 Page 6-116  

 
 

Therefore, the likely residual Project effect for bats is modified in Table 6.25 to include only change in 
habitat. 

Change in Habitat 
Forest edges are often associated with elevated bat foraging activity, likely since they provide movement 
corridors or accumulate insects (Hein et al. 2009, Jantzen 2012, Morris et al. 2010). The Project will likely 
create foraging habitat for bat species that forage for insects in the open (e.g., little brown bats), however, 
reduce foraging habitat for clutter-adapted bat species (e.g., northern myotis) that forage in the understory 
of forests (Patriquin and Barclay 2003, Morris et al. 2010). 

The potential adverse effects of the Project on bats are primarily limited to the direct removal or degradation 
of tree roosting habitat. Caves and mines as well as tall rock faces with deep fissures are likely the primary 
hibernation habitat for bats, and may also be used as roosting habitat during the summer (Nagorsen and 
Brigham 1993, Lausen and Barclay 2006). There are no known caves, abandoned mines or steep 
topography with rock faces along the proposed route (Appendix 5). Tree-cavities are also extensively used 
for roosting by several bat species, and may be used as hibernacula in warmer climates (Kalcounis-Rüppell 
et al. 2005, Nagorsen and Brigham 1993). Suitable tree-cavity roosting habitat is most often associated 
with large-diameter decaying trees in old mixed or deciduous forests, which contain cavities, crevices or 
sloughing bark where bats can hide (Kalcounis-Rüppell et al. 2005). Clearing of mature forest for Project 
construction may reduce tree roosting habitat for bats. 

The residual effect of the Project on bats will be low in magnitude given the pipeline route is in an area of 
relatively intense resource use and the Footprint will be reclaimed to native vegetation (Table 6.25, 
point [b]).  

Forest Birds 

Change in Habitat  
Canada warbler and olive-sided flycatcher have been selected as representative of forest bird species listed 
under Schedule 1 of the SARA or by COSEWIC with potential to occur along the pipeline route. Canada 
warblers have been found to prefer moist to wet deciduous or mixedwood forests in various seral stages, 
with well-developed shrub layers and high levels of coarse woody debris (Campbell et al. 1990). Olive-sided 
flycatcher (Threatened on Schedule 1 of SARA and by COSEWIC) is typically associated with forest 
openings (e.g., fens, bogs, swamps, logged areas, burned forest), forest edges (e.g., near wetlands) or 
open forest stands. Tall trees or snags are essential for foraging (perches) and nesting. In the boreal forest 
of western Canada, suitable olive-sided flycatcher habitat is more likely to occur in or near wetlands and in 
young forest associated with burns and clear-cuts that contain residual live trees (COSEWIC 2007b). 

Clearing for Project construction and maintenance will affect forest birds as a result of habitat loss or 
alteration, fragmentation and changes in habitat connectivity. Habitat alteration as a result of forest clearing 
can result in losses and/or shifts in forest bird population dynamics. Short and long-term declines of various 
species of forest adapted bird have been attributed to reduction and fragmentation of forest cover (Lynch 
and Whigham 1984, Sekercioglu et al. 2002, Schmiegelow and Monkkonen 2002). Construction and 
operation of the pipeline will create new forest clearing, increase the existing corridor width where existing 
rights-of-way are paralleled, remove potential nesting and perch trees, and require ongoing clearing as part 
of vegetation management during operation. This will result in the long-term conversion of forest habitat to 
earlier seral stages (forb and shrub stages) until the pipeline is decommissioned and disturbed areas are 
reclaimed.  

Habitat that may support Canada warbler occurs along the length of the proposed pipeline route (i.e., in 
stands of deciduous and mixedwood forest), in areas where there is a well-developed and complex 
understory. Potential habitat for olive-sided flycatcher is associated with forest openings, forest edges and 
wetlands where open or shrubby habitats are interspersed with tall trees that could provide perches. 

Construction of the pipeline will result in clearing of approximately 48.0 ha of forested areas and 59.1 ha of 
regenerating forested areas. The area of habitat loss or alteration potentially affecting forest birds is reduced 
by routing the pipeline along existing linear corridors (i.e., pipeline rights-of-way and road) for 78% of its

length, utilizing workspace on existing adjacent disturbances (49% of the Footprint overlaps existing 
anthropogenic disturbance), reclaiming the Project Footprint including construction and reclamation 
methods that accelerate woody vegetation regeneration (e.g., limited grubbing and grading), and limiting 
vegetation management along the pipeline right-of-way during operation.  

Change in Movement 
Canada warbler may be affected by habitat fragmentation and changes in habitat connectivity given that it 
is associated with mixedwood forests with a well-developed shrub layer, although it can also be found in 
regenerating forests (COSEWIC 2008). Studies have linked olive-sided flycatcher with highly fragmented 
landscapes, suggesting that they may prefer edge habitat (COSEWIC 2007b). Forest openings created by 
the pipeline are unlikely to affect movement for olive-sided flycatcher.  

The width of the pipeline construction right-of-way is 27 m (where paralleling existing TransCanada 
rights-of-way, it is 17 m of permanent right-of-way and 10 m of temporary workspace), plus additional 
temporary workspace of varying width where required. Routing the pipeline along existing linear 
disturbances (i.e., pipeline rights-of-way and roads) for 78% of its length, limiting vegetation management 
along the pipeline right-of-way to the extent feasible, and completing reclamation as soon after construction 
as possible is expected to reduce potential changes to forest bird habitat connectivity by minimizing 
fragmentation of residual forest patches.  

Change in Mortality Risk 
Clearing and construction activities are scheduled outside of the migratory bird nesting period (May 1 to 
August 10), the federal timing restriction of May 1 to July 31 for Canada warbler nests, and the federal 
timing restriction of May 1 to August 31 for olive-sided flycatcher nests (Gregoire pers. comm.). In the event 
that the schedule changes and construction activities are planned during the migratory bird nesting period, 
it is recommended that the Project Footprint be cleared prior to May 1 to discourage nesting of migratory 
birds. If this is not feasible and activity is scheduled to occur within the migratory bird nesting period, 
non-intrusive methods will be used to conduct an area search for evidence of nesting (e.g., presence of 
singing birds, territorial males, alarm calls, distraction displays). In the event an active nest is found, it will 
be subject to site-specific mitigation measures (i.e., clearly marked protective buffer around the nest and/or 
non-intrusive monitoring), subject to consultation with AESRD. 

Since scheduling of construction activities is outside the migratory bird nesting period, the probability that 
forest bird nests will be affected by construction activities is low. However, the combined effect of the Project 
on forest birds is considered a high probability since the Project will affect habitat. With the implementation 
of mitigation, the residual effect will be of low magnitude (Table 6.25, point [c]). 

Wetland Birds 

Change in Habitat  
Rusty blackbird, horned grebe and yellow rail are species reliant on boreal forest wetland habitats that have 
potential to occur in the Project area and are listed under Schedule 1 of the SARA and/or by COSEWIC. 
Although these species have different habitat requirements (e.g., shallow, open-water forested wetlands 
are suitable for rusty blackbird; horned grebe breeding ponds must contain areas of open water and beds 
of emergent vegetation; yellow rails are found in wetlands (e.g., fens) dominated by sedges, grasses and 
rushes where there is little or no standing water [generally 0-12 cm water depth], and where the substrate 
remains saturated throughout the summer) (Federation of Alberta Naturalists 2007, Semenchuk 1992), the 
construction and operation of the pipeline is expected to similarly affect these species as a result of changes 
in habitat through vegetation clearing and potentially alteration of water quality and wetland function. The 
Project crosses suitable habitat for rusty blackbird and yellow rail, and the riparian marsh near Bald 
Mountain Creek provides potential habitat for horned grebe in the vicinity of the proposed route. 

The pipeline route crosses approximately 0.9 km of wetland habitat (i.e., a treed bog, mixedwood treed 
swamp, shrubby swamp, wet meadow and shrubby fen). The effects of construction of a pipeline 
right-of-way on wetland vegetation and bird communities were investigated up to two years following 
construction by Santillo (1993). Results showed that: there was a fairly high similarity of species 
composition and structure among study wetlands two years after construction, regardless of wetland type,

except for a wetland with standing water; and no new bird species were introduced as a result of the different 
habitat provided by the construction right-of-way. 

Change in Movement 
Since clearing, construction and clean-up activities are scheduled to occur outside of the migratory bird 
nesting (i.e., May 1 to August 10) (Gregoire pers. comm), Project construction activities are not expected 
to affect wetland bird movement.  

Change in Mortality Risk 
Clearing and construction activities are scheduled outside of the migratory bird nesting period (May 1 to 
August 10) (Gregoire pers. comm.) and will avoid the federal timing restrictions of April 1 to August 31 and 
May 1 to July 31 for horned grebe and rusty blackbird, respectively (Gregoire pers. comm.). In the event 
that site preparation (i.e., clearing/mowing) and construction is to occur during this period, non-intrusive 
methods will be used to conduct an area search for evidence of nesting (e.g., presence of singing birds, 
territorial males, alarm calls, distraction displays). In the event an active nest is found, it will be subject to 
site-specific mitigation measures (i.e., clearly marked protective buffer around the nest and/or non-intrusive 
monitoring), subject to consultation with AESRD. 

Since clearing and construction activities are scheduled outside of the nesting period, the probability that 
wetland bird nests will be affected by construction activities is low, however, the probability that wetland 
habitat will be altered is high. With the implementation of mitigation, the residual effect will be of low 
magnitude (Table 6.25, point [d]). 

Western Toad 

Change in Habitat  
Western toads (Special Concern on Schedule 1 of SARA and by COSEWIC) require wetland and upland 
habitats, and movement corridors between these areas (COSEWIC 2012b). Western toads breed in a 
variety of natural and artificial aquatic habitats, including ponds, stream edges and the shallow margins of 
lakes, as well as in ditches and road ruts (COSEWIC 2012b). Outside of the breeding season, adult toads 
disperse into forested areas, wet shrub lands, avalanche slopes, subalpine meadows and wetland habitats 
not necessarily used for egg laying (COSEWIC 2012b). Western toads do not appear to be dependent upon 
mature or old-growth forest and favour dense shrub cover, which provides protection from desiccation and 
predation (COSEWIC 2012b).  

An adult western toad was observed on the proposed Project right-of-way in mature deciduous forest at 
KP 5.8 during the field work completed in June 2010 for the Cutbank River Lateral Loop (Bald Mountain 
Section), but no breeding pond was observed (TERA Environmental Consultants 2010d). During the 
June 2014 field work, western toad adults were heard/observed at two locations: an adult western toad was 
heard in a riparian marsh located approximately 25 m east of the pipeline right-of-way at KP 4.6 (which is 
3 m east of the proposed Bald Mountain Creek contingency crossing location); and western toad adults 
were observed (visual and auditory) in a shrubby fen on the pipeline right-of-way at KP 27.1. Western toad 
tadpoles were observed in two low-lying depressions on an existing right-of-way adjacent to the Project: 
approximately 32 m west of the proposed pipeline right-of-way at KP 9.7; and within proposed temporary 
workspace for the Project at KP 27.4. The Project may potentially result in the alteration of approximately 
0.9 km of wetland habitat. 

Change in Movement 
Browne and Paszkowski (2010) found that radio tracked western toads in boreal forests of north-central 
Alberta traveled a distance, on average, of about 1,086 m between breeding and hibernation sites 
(range = 146 to 1,936 m). Western toads have been found to occasionally move several kilometres in a 
directional manner (Davis 2000). Since western toads move overland by climbing and crawling 
(COSEWIC 2012b), their movements are potentially affected by anthropogenic disturbances such as 
facilities, fences (including silt or snow fences), soil berms, ditches or deep ruts. Linear corridors 
(e.g., pipeline rights-of-way) are unlikely to affect toad movement. Clearing and construction of the pipeline 
route is scheduled for the winter, when western toads are inactive.

Change in Mortality Risk 
Western toad response to habitat alteration is often expressed as increased mortality risk associated with 
predation (e.g., cleared areas may support higher populations of predators), low juvenile recruitment in 
artificial breeding ponds that dry before metamorphosis, and desiccation (small metamorphs are particularly 
vulnerable to desiccation when trapped in road ruts or where riparian vegetation is disturbed) 
(COSEWIC 2012b).  

Western toads overwinter in a variety of sites, including banks of spring seeps and streams, willow clumps, 
the base of trees and small mammal burrows (COSEWIC 2012b). In the eastern part of their range 
(north-central Alberta), western toads use a variety of habitats for hibernation, including marshes, peat 
wetlands, dry and wet meadows, deciduous and coniferous forest, wet shrubland, and burned forests 
(Browne and Paszkowski 2010). Coniferous forests appear to be selected in disproportion to their 
availability (Browne and Paszkowski 2010). Within these areas, hibernation often occurs within tunnels and 
crevices, such as those created by small mammals (e.g., red squirrels) and decaying root masses (Browne 
and Paszkowski 2010). Western toads are vulnerable during hibernation in the winter to activities that cause 
soil disturbance. Soil compaction due to machinery and vehicles could decrease toads’ ability to burrow 
into the soil and, therefore, potentially increase mortality due to desiccation or predation (Russell and Bauer 
2000). The mitigation measures provided (e.g., minimizing grading, grubbing and clearing to the extent 
feasible, implementing measures such as packing snow or using mats to avoid excessive soil compaction 
on the Project Footprint, particularly in proximity to wetlands and watercourses) are expected to reduce the 
potential residual effect of the Project on western toad mortality risk as a result of hibernation habitat 
disturbance.  

The combined effect of the Project on the western toad is considered to be low magnitude with the 
implementation of planned mitigation measures (Table 6.25, point [e]). 

Summary 
As identified in Table 6.25, there are no situations where there is a high probability of occurrence of a 
permanent or long-term residual environmental effect on species at risk of high magnitude that cannot be 
technically mitigated. Consequently, it is concluded that the residual environmental effect of Project 
construction and operation on species at risk will be not significant. 

6.2.12 Human Occupancy and Resource Use 

6.2.12.1 Spatial Boundaries 

The spatial boundaries used in the effects assessment on human occupancy and resource use (Figure 6.9) 
considered one or more of the following areas: 

• a Footprint Study Area (as defined in Section 1.4);  

• a HORU LSA; and  

• a HORU RSA.  

The HORU LSA (Figure 6.8) is defined as an approximate 2 km wide band centred on the proposed pipeline 
route centre line (i.e., 1 km on both sides of the centre line) and an approximate 1.5 km band extending 
from the meter station boundary. The HORU LSA was established to provide adequate consideration to 
existing land and resource uses (e.g., trapping, hunting, fishing, protected areas) in the Project area. The 
HORU RSA is defined as an approximate 30 km band centred on the proposed pipeline route centre line 
(i.e., 15 km on both sides of the centre line) and a 5 km radius centred in the centre of the meter station.  

The spatial boundary for the HORU RSA includes the RSA boundaries of water quality and quantity, fish 
and fish habitat, wetlands, vegetation, wildlife and wildlife habitat and heritage resources. The HORU RSA 
was selected to reflect the general setting and describe resource use related elements that could be 
indirectly affected by the Project (e.g., consumptive and non-consumptive recreation, hunting, fishing, 
trapping, guide outfitting). The HORU LSA and RSA are spatial boundaries that are used to better assess 
elements with potential effects assessed at the spatial level and not using a community-based spatial 
boundary.

6.2.12.2 Human Occupancy and Resource Use Context 

The Project is located entirely on Crown land in the Green Area of Alberta in the MD of Greenview. As 
noted, the role of the MD of Greenview is limited in the Project area since most Crown lands are under 
provincial control; however, the objective of the MD of Greenview is to co-operate with provincial 
government departments in the planning and development processes affecting Crown lands. The MD of 
Greenview MDP (By-law No. 03-397) includes land use planning objectives that acknowledge the oil and 
gas industry as an important component of the region’s economy. Additionally, the MDP recognizes oil and 
gas exploration activities as acceptable use within the municipal boundaries, subject to the necessary 
government permits (MD of Greenview 2003a). 

Recreational use of lands in the HORU RSA includes camping, hiking, canoeing/kayaking, fishing, boating 
and all-terrain vehicle use. There are no conservation and recreation tourism areas or forest recreation 
areas in the HORU LSA and RSA (Government of Alberta 2012, AltaLIS 2008a). Given the location of the 
Project, very little interaction of the Project with local and regional recreational activities is expected. The 
pipeline route does not cross any rural or urban residential areas, agricultural areas, protected areas, lands 
under Parks Canada jurisdiction, or other ecological reserves or preserves (AESRD 2013, AltaLIS 2008b, 
2012a). 

Land users in the HORU LSA and RSA include forestry operations, oil and gas development, 
recreationalists (e.g., kayakers and canoeists), guide outfitters, hunters, fishers, trappers and Aboriginal 
communities. 

There are 21 water wells within approximately 1 km of the proposed pipeline route centre line, including 
12 industrial wells, 6 for investigations, 1 domestic well, 1 listed as unknown and 1 listed as other 
(AESRD 2014c). There are 10 water wells within approximately 1.5 km of the meter station, all of which are 
listed for industrial use (AESRD 2014d).

6.2.12.3 Potential Effects, Mitigation Measures and Potential Residual Effects 

Potential effects on HORU associated with the Project were based on the results of a literature review, a 
desktop analysis and identified by the assessment team and are listed in Table 6.26. 

A summary of mitigation to reduce the severity of potential effects of the Project on HORU are presented 
in Table 6.26. These measures were developed in accordance with NGTL standards and several industry 
and provincial regulatory guidelines.  

Through the implementation of mitigation identified in Table 6.26, the Project will meet the related 
management direction of the MD of Greenview’s MDP and Land Use Bylaw pertaining to land use planning 
and HORU provided in Table 5.1. 

Effects of the Project on human habitation and agricultural use were considered for inclusion in this 
assessment, but were scoped out due to the limited anticipated Project-related interaction. The nearest 
community is the Hamlet of Grovedale, located approximately 14 km northeast of KP 0.0. The Project is 
situated on forested land and the pipeline follows existing rights-of-way for approximately 78% of the route.

6.2.12.4 Significance Evaluation of Potential Residual Effects 

A qualitative assessment was considered the most appropriate method to evaluate the significance of 
potential residual effects on HORU, due to the lack of quantitative data and accepted standards, guidelines 
and ecological thresholds. This qualitative assessment relied on available research literature and the 
professional judgement of the assessment team.  

Table 6.27 provides a summary of the significance evaluation of potential residual socio-economic effects 
of the construction and operation of the Project on HORU. The rationale used to evaluate the significance 
of each of the residual socio-economic effects is provided below. An evaluation of significance is not 
required for those potential effects where no residual effect is identified. All assessment criteria were 
considered when determining the significance of each residual effect, but the most influential assessment 
criteria were reversibility, magnitude and probability.

EVALUATION OF SIGNIFICANCE - HUMAN OCCUPANCY AND RESOURCE USE 

Potential 
Residual Effect Criteria Rating Effects Characterization Rationale 

a. Decrease in quality 
of the outdoor 
recreational 
experience of 
resource users 
during construction 
and site-specific 
maintenance 

Impact balance: 
Negative 

• The quality of the outdoor recreational experience of 
resource users during construction and site-specific 
maintenance can decrease. 

Spatial boundary: 
HORU RSA 

• Noise and air emissions caused by construction and site-
specific maintenance extend into the HORU RSA. 

Duration: Short-term • The event causing the decrease in quality of the outdoor 
recreational experience is completed in the construction 
phase or within any given year during operations. 

Frequency: Periodic • The event causing the decrease in quality of the outdoor 
recreational experience occurs intermittently but may 
occur repeatedly over the assessment period. 

Reversibility: 
Short-Term 

• Decrease in quality of the outdoor recreational experience 
is limited to the construction phase and site-specific 
maintenance which may be completed within any given 
year during operations. 

Magnitude: Low • Changes may be detectable, but will primarily be that of 
an inconvenience or nuisance. 

Probability: High • Project construction activity will occur in areas used for 
outdoor recreation and site-specific maintenance activities 
will be required as part of regular operations and may 
involve the use of heavy and light equipment and vehicles. 

Confidence: High • The determination of significance is based on a good 
understanding of cause-effect relationships using data 
pertinent to the Project area. 

Significance: Not 
significant  

• The decrease in the quality of outdoor recreational 
experience during Project construction is of low magnitude 
and reversible in the short-term and, therefore, considered 
to be not significant. 

b. Sensory 
disturbance for 
land and resource 
users 

Impact balance: 
Negative 

• Construction activities and site-specific maintenance 
along the pipeline and at the meter station may cause 
socio-economic effects due to sensory disturbance. 

Spatial boundary: 
HORU LSA 

• Sensory disturbances for land and resource users from 
construction and site-specific maintenance extend into the 
HORU LSA.  

Duration: Immediate 
to Short-Term 

• The event causing immediate sensory disturbance is 
nuisance noise as a result of construction activities 
(immediate). Certain maintenance activities may take less 
than 2 days (e.g., aerial patrol) while others may take 
longer however, less than 1 year to complete (e.g., 
integrity dig), resulting in short-term sensory disturbance. 

Frequency: Isolated 
to Periodic 

• The event causing sensory disturbance (i.e., nuisance air 
or noise emissions) is confined to a specific period and is 
expected to occur intermittently, however, may occur 
repeatedly over the assessment period. 

Reversibility: 
Immediate to 
Short-Term 

• The effects associated with sensory disturbance will be 
alleviated when construction is completed. Certain 
maintenance activities may take less than 2 days 
(e.g., aerial patrol) while others may take longer however, 
less than 1 year to complete (e.g., integrity dig).

land users. 

Confidence: High • The determination of significance is based on a good 
understanding of cause-effect relationships using data 
pertinent to the Project area. 

Significance: Not 
significant  

• The sensory disturbance to land and resource users are of 
low magnitude and is reversible in the immediate to short-
term, and therefore, is considered to be not significant.  

c. Alteration of 
viewsheds 

Impact balance: 
Negative 

• The visual quality of the landscape may be adversely 
affected by the Project. 

Spatial boundary: 
HORU LSA 

• The change in visual quality will extend into the HORU 
LSA.  

Duration: Short-term • The event causing the alteration of viewsheds will occur 
during the construction phase. 

Frequency: Isolated • The event causing the alteration of viewsheds is confined 
to the construction phase. 

Reversibility: 
Long-Term 

• The alteration of viewsheds due to the Project will extend 
throughout the operations phase. 

Magnitude: Low • The mitigation measures provided reduce the potential 
residual effect to that of an inconvenience or nuisance. 

Probability: High • The Project will involve clearing and construction activities 
and new above ground features will be built (i.e., meter 
station, valve sites). 

Confidence: High • The determination of significance is based on a good 
understanding of cause-effect relationships using data 
pertinent to the Project area. 

Significance: Not 
significant  

• The alteration of viewsheds is reversible in the long-term; 
however, is of low magnitude and therefore, considered 
not significant.  

d. Reduction in timber 
supply 

Impact balance: 
Negative 

• There may be loss of forestry resources and a reduction of 
land base for timber harvest as a result of construction 
and operations of the Project. 

Spatial boundary: 
Footprint 

• The loss of forestry resources would occur along the 
Footprint. 

Duration: Short-term • The event causing the loss of forestry resources occurs 
during the construction phase. 

Frequency: Isolated • The event causing the loss of forestry resources is 
confined to the construction phase. 

Reversibility: Long-
term 

• The loss of forestry resources will extend throughout the 
operations phase. 

Magnitude: Low • The implementation of the proposed mitigation measures 
is expected to effectively reduce the effects of the loss of 
timber resources on land users.  

Probability: High • The Project will result in the reduction in loss of forestry 
resources and reduction of land base for timber. 

Confidence: High • The determination of significance is based on a good 
understanding of cause-effect relationships using data 
pertinent to the Project area. 

Significance: Not 
significant  

• The loss of forestry resources is reversible in the long-
term and has a high probability of occurring; however, is of 
low magnitude and is therefore, considered not significant.

Decrease in Quality of the Outdoor Recreational Experience  

Construction 
The outdoor recreational experiences of resource users, such as hiking, camping, wildlife viewing, hunting 
and fishing may be affected by the physical disturbance to outdoor recreation areas during Project 
construction. The Project is located in one WMU (Cutbank 356) and this area could potentially be used for 
hunting. Nuisance air emissions, noise and visual effects may also occur during the construction of the 
Project (i.e., construction of pipeline and meter station) and could affect land users living, working or using 
the land for recreational use in the vicinity of the right-of-way.  

Site-Specific Maintenance  
The outdoor recreational experience of resource users may be affected by site-specific maintenance. Use 
of outdoor water and land based recreation areas, such as waterways, may be disturbed or disrupted by 
site-specific maintenance (e.g., aerial patrols, vegetation management, integrity digs) which will occur 
periodically throughout the operations phase of the Project, along the pipeline route and at the meter station. 
These activities will involve workers and equipment that could result in nuisance air and noise emissions. 
Where the pipeline route parallels existing linear disturbance (78%) these activities will be comparable to 
existing operations and not considered to be a change. 

With the implementation of the mitigation provided in Table 6.26, the potential residual effect during 
construction and site-specific maintenance is considered to be of low magnitude and reversible in the 
short-term (Table 6.27, point [a]). 

Sensory Disturbance for Land and Resource Users  
Nuisance air emissions and noise will occur during the construction of the Project (i.e., pipeline and meter 
station) and may at times affect land users living and using the land for recreational use in the vicinity of 
the Project. Possible effects may include air emissions (including odours), and noise and dust from 
construction equipment and vehicles. Also, equipment, areas of land disturbance, and the activity of 
construction workers will be visible to nearby land and resource users during periods of construction and 
site-specific maintenance.  

The primary source of CAC emissions during construction will be from slash burning and vehicle and 
equipment operation. Slash burning activities will account for the largest sources of SO2 and CO emissions. 
Construction equipment operation will be the largest source of NOx. Fugitive dust from on-road equipment 
use will be the largest source of PM. Nuisance air and noise emissions will occur for isolated periods of 
time at specific locations during periodic site-specific maintenance activities (e.g., aerial patrols, vegetation 
management, integrity digs) during the operation phase of the Project.  

The low population density in areas of the Project will result in less people being potentially affected, due 
to the decreased presence of human receptors. The implementation of the mitigation measures provided 
will reduce the effects of noise and air emissions (including odours) on land users.  

With the implementation of the mitigation provided in Table 6.26, the potential residual effect is considered 
to be of low magnitude, reversible in the immediate to short-term and is therefore, not significant 
(Table 6.27, point [b]). 

Alteration of Viewshed 
The pipeline component of the Project is anticipated to have long term visual effects related to the presence 
of the new construction right-of-way, as well as new above ground permanent and temporary infrastructure 
(i.e., valve sites) (see Section 2.0). This may affect the quality or experience of certain viewsheds for some 
land and resource users. The impact balance of this residual effect is considered negative, but low in 
magnitude as it is considered primarily that of a nuisance or inconvenience. In addition to the mitigation 
measures provided in Table 6.26, potential long-term visual effects of new pipeline right-of-way will be 
reduced by paralleling an existing linear disturbance for a majority (78%) of the route.

Construction of the meter station component of the Project will also result in a new long-term landscape 
changes. However, given that Highway 40 is approximately 15 km east of the meter station, and that traffic 
is anticipated to travel at the posted 100 km/h speed limit, the likelihood of the permanent meter station 
detracting from a visual experience is reduced.  

With the implementation of the mitigation provided in Table 6.26, the potential residual effect is considered 
to be of low magnitude and reversible in the long-term (Table 6.27, point [c]). 

Reduction in Timber Supply 
The construction of the Project (i.e.¸ pipeline and meter station) will involve clearing of forested areas and 
a long-term reduction in timber supply. Salvageable timber removal from the right-of-way will result in a loss 
of land available for future harvesting. Merchantable timber removed will be transported to conversion 
facilities (e.g., mills and plants) or other end users where feasible. An environmentally responsible and 
economically efficient timber salvage plan is being developed for the Project.  

During the operation phase, the pipeline route will remain as a long-term linear disturbance, although the 
pipeline route parallels existing rights-of-way to the extent practical. Native tree species will not be replanted 
on the right-of-way as pipelines are actively managed to prevent tree regeneration, and tree species cannot 
be replanted where permanent infrastructure is located (Braun and Hanus 2005).  

Forestry remains an important contributor to the local economy in the HORU RSA. Construction of the 
Project may have an effect on forest harvesting operations as forest companies may have to alter 
harvesting plans to accommodate changes in the forested land base due to the Project. During construction, 
temporary access roads managed by forest licensees may be used to transport Project equipment and 
personnel. Use of temporary access roads could create safety implications for forest companies that are 
active in the area.  

Temporary and permanent infrastructure for the Project will also introduce a new feature in the tenured 
area that forestry companies might have to consider in forest harvest planning and in meeting biodiversity 
or other regulatory objectives.  

With the implementation of the mitigation provided in Table 6.26, the potential residual effect is considered 
to be of low magnitude and reversible in the long-term reversibility (Table 6.27, point [d]). 

Disruption of Trapping, Hunting, Fishing and Outfitting Activities  
Outfitting, trapping, hunting and fishing activities occur along the pipeline route and throughout the HORU 
RSA. In 2013, there were 22 guide outfitters operating in the WMUs crossed by the Project (Heppner pers. 
comm.) and five registered trapping areas are crossed by the pipeline route. There are 11 fish-bearing 
watercourses that may be used for fishing crossed by the pipeline route. Hunting and fishing occurs 
throughout the HORU RSA. Construction and site-specific maintenance could disrupt guide outfitting, 
trapping, hunting and fishing activities by creating land disturbances, increasing noise and dust, decreasing 
safety for land users, affecting targeted wildlife species, changing access, affecting local economies and 
livelihoods. 

Activities associated with construction and maintenance of the Project (i.e., the pipeline and meter station), 
including right-of-way clearing and clean-up, may affect these resource users in the immediate vicinity of 
construction activities. Construction will clear vegetation and create land disturbances using heavy 
machinery that will release noise and emissions; the quality of the user experience may be affected; and 
construction and clean-up will overlap with hunting seasons and trapping activities. However, trappers will 
be compensated for demonstrated economic losses. In addition, land disturbances could result in habitat 
loss or alteration, change wildlife movement patterns and increase wildlife or fish mortality. Potential effects 
on wildlife are discussed in Section 6.2.10 and potential effects on fish are discussed in Section 6.2.7. 
Construction of the Project may change access to areas by either restricting access to sites or improving 
access to areas that may otherwise have had limited accessibility. Effects during construction will be 
managed by the mitigation measures in Table 6.26. Operation of the Project, aside from site-specific 
maintenance, is not expected to affect outfitting, hunting, trapping or fishing.

With the implementation of the mitigation provided in Table 6.26, the potential residual effect is considered 
to be of low magnitude reversible in the short-term (Table 6.27, point [e]). 

Combined Effects on HORU 
The evaluation of combined effects on HORU considers all of the potential residual effects evaluated in 
Table 6.22 (points [a] through [e]) that are likely to occur as a result of the construction and operation of the 
Project, and that could act in combination in the HORU RSA. The following potential residual effects are 
likely to occur and may act in combination to result in overall effects on HORU during construction and 
operation of the Project: 

• decrease in quality of outdoor recreational experience of resource users during 
construction and site-specific maintenance; 

• sensory disturbance for land and resource users; 

• alteration of viewsheds; 

• reduction in timber supply; and 

• disruption of outfitting and non-traditional trapping, hunting and fishing activities of land 
users during construction. 

With the implementation of the applicable mitigation provided in Table 6.26, combined effects on human 
occupancy and resource are considered reversible in the short to long-term, low in magnitude, and 
therefore, not significant (Table 6.27, point [f]). 

6.2.12.5 Summary 

As identified in Table 6.27, there are no situations for HORU that would result in a significant 
socio-economic residual effect. Consequently, it is concluded that the residual socio-economic effects of 
pipeline construction and operation on HORU will be not significant. 

6.2.13 Heritage Resources 

6.2.13.1 Spatial Boundaries 

The spatial boundaries used in the effects assessment on heritage resources considered one or more of 
the following areas: 

• a Footprint Study Area (as defined in Section 1.4); and 

• a Heritage Resources RSA. 

The spatial boundaries of the Heritage Resources RSA (Figure 6.9) for the Project comprise the area 
extending beyond the Footprint and are defined as an area of adjoining Borden Blocks intersected by the 
pipeline route (Borden and Duff 1952). A Borden Block measures 10 minutes of latitude by 10 minutes of 
longitude which is the accepted standard division of land used by archaeologists across Canada. For the 
Project, the Borden Blocks intersected by the proposed pipeline route measure approximately 12 km 
east-west by 18 km north-south.  

6.2.13.2 Heritage Resources Context 

The potential for encountering heritage resources is reduced by aligning the pipeline route to parallel 
existing linear disturbances to the extent feasible. No previously recorded heritage resources sites have 
been identified within the Project Footprint. For the HRIA, background data was reviewed and subsequently 
complemented with ground reconnaissance which targeted areas for more intensive visual inspection and, 
where warranted, shovel testing. Fieldwork was conducted by qualified Archaeologists with assistance from 
members of Aseniwuche Winewak Nation, Horse Lake First Nation, Métis Nation 6, Kelly Lake First Nation 
and Kelly Lake Métis. An HRIA of the pipeline corridor and proposed meter station commenced in June and

August 2014 under Alberta Culture Archaeological Research Permit 14-106 under frost-free and snow-free 
conditions. The ground reconnaissance and shovel testing programs focused on the areas along the 
pipeline route and the proposed meter station that are of moderate to high potential for archaeological and 
historic and sites. No previously recorded archaeological or historical sites were recorded in the vicinity of 
the Project. During HRIA fieldwork for the Project, a total of 183 shovel tests were dug in areas of 
archaeological potential. One new archaeological site (GfQr-3) was recorded within the Project Footprint. 
No historic sites have been recorded within the Project Footprint. Newly recorded archaeological site GfQr-3 
is an isolated, pre-contact, subsurface lithic find located within the Project Footprint on the uplands and 
terraces in the vicinity of Bald Mountain Creek (Western Crossing Option). Subsequent to the recording of 
GfQr-3, the Project Footprint was amended and the site is no longer within the Project Footprint. As a result, 
GfQr-3 will not be affected by Project activities.  

The meter station site is not located within any area listed as having an HRV value (ACT 2014). 

NGTL will implement recommendations from ACT and will provide the NEB with a copy of the Historical 
Resources Act clearance letter upon receipt.  

With regards to palaeontological resources, the pipeline route and proposed meter station cross no 
quarter-sections listed as having an HRV value for palaeontological resources in the current Listing of 
Historical Resources (ACT 2014). According to Dr. Paul McNeil of Steppe Consulting Limited, there is low 
potential for the pipeline to impact palaeontological resources.
