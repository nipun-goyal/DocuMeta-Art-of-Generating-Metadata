EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL), a wholly owned subsidiary of TransCanada PipeLines Limited 
(TransCanada), is proposing to construct and operate the Cutbank River Lateral Loop No. 2 (Pinto Creek 
Section) Pipeline and the Musreau Lake North Receipt Meter Station (meter station) (collectively, the 
Project). The Project is required to meet incremental producer requests for transportation of sweet natural 
gas from the northwest area of the NGTL Alberta System. The proposed pipeline will transport natural gas 
from the Cutbank River Lateral Loop system with a launching trap at NE 21-65-7 W6M (KP 32.3) to the 
Grande Prairie Mainline (dual tie-in) with receiving trap at NW 24-68-7 W6M (KP 0). A proposed 60 m 
x 60 m meter station, located at SE-26-62-6 W6M, is also included in the Project application (Figure 1.1).  

The Project will involve the construction of approximately 32 km of 610 mm O.D. (NPS 24) pipeline. The 
proposed Project will parallel NGTL’s existing and operational Cutbank River Lateral pipelines or other 
rights-of-way for approximately 78% of its length.  

The Project’s right-of-way will be 17 m wide where paralleling existing TransCanada rights-of-way and 27 m 
wide elsewhere. Additional areas for temporary workspace of varying width will be required at select 
locations along the entire length of the Project to accommodate construction activities (i.e., shoo-flies, log 
decks, construction office sites, staging areas, and material and pipe stockpile sites). Where feasible, 
existing highways, resource roads and the proposed right-of-way will be used to access the Project site. 
Valve sites are proposed to support the pipeline and are located entirely on previously disturbed 
right-of-way, adjacent to existing NGTL facilities. No camps are needed for construction and operation of 
the Project.  

NGTL commissioned TERA, a CH2M HILL Company (TERA) to prepare an Environmental and 
Socio-Economic Assessment (ESA) to satisfy the requirements of Section 58 of the National Energy Board 
(NEB) Act for approval of this Project. Subject to regulatory approvals, pipeline and meter station 
construction is scheduled to commence in Q4 2015 with a targeted in-service date of Q2 2016. 

Pursuant to Guide A.2.1 of the NEB Filing Manual, the level of detail contained in this report corresponds 
to the nature and magnitude of the anticipated environmental effects and has been prepared to meet NEB 
requirements for a Section 58 Application. An ESA checklist of the NEB Filing Manual requirements is 
provided in this ESA. In addition, the ESA has been prepared to meet the requirements of the NEB Online 
Application System guidance. 

The following field surveys and desktop assessments were conducted by TERA to support the ESA and 
inform the Environmental Protection Plan (EPP) (Appendix 1) and the Environmental Alignment Sheets 
(Appendix 2): an aquatic assessment (Appendix 3); a wetland evaluation (Appendix 4); a vegetation survey 
(Appendix 5); and a wildlife report (Appendix 6). The Alberta Culture and Tourism Historical Resources Act 
Schedule ‘B’ Approval and Requirements (Appendix 7) as well as a Traditional Knowledge report 
(Appendix 8), are also included.  

The Project is located in a forested setting within the Municipal District of Greenview No. 16 (MD of 
Greenview). All of the lands crossed by the proposed pipeline route and associated facilities are 
Crown-owned and lie within the Green Area of Alberta. The nearest community to the pipeline route is the 
Hamlet of Grovedale (approximately 15 km north/northeast of the Project) while the nearest community 
with full services is the City of Grande Prairie, approximately 30 km northeast of the Project. The nearest 
residence is a cabin located approximately 550 m west of KP 2.7. The proposed pipeline route is located 
in the Peace River Basin and crosses 11 watercourses, including Bald Mountain Creek and its tributaries, 
and 28 nonfish-bearing drainages. The pipeline route crosses five wetland ecosystems, comprising 
approximately 2.8% (approximately 0.9 km) of the proposed route. The Project is situated within an Inactive 
Holding Zone as part of the Alberta Mountain Pine Beetle Management Strategy. The proposed meter 
station site is located within a provincially identified Secondary Grizzly Bear Zone.  

Potential environmental concerns identified by this ESA include: issues relating to strippings conservation; 
soil erosion control; potential effects on downstream water quality; potential introduction and spread of 
weeds; potential increase in the spread of bark beetles; incremental loss of remnant native vegetation; and 
potential effects on wildlife. Watercourse crossings and preliminary wetland crossings have been located 
and construction of the crossings has been planned in a manner which will reduce bank and slope instability,

as well as the potential for future erosion. Specific environmental measures have been identified for 
watercourse crossing construction, strippings handling and protection of wildlife. These measures, along 
with other protection measures designed to mitigate the potential environmental effects, are identified in 
the EPP in Appendix 1 and on the Environmental Alignment Sheets in Appendix 2. 

The environmental effects associated with the Project are those that are routinely encountered during 
pipeline and facility construction in a forested setting. The application of mitigation measures through a 
comprehensive environmental compliance strategy (environmental protection planning, environmental 
inspection and post-construction monitoring) will avoid, eliminate and/or reduce the severity of potential 
Project-related adverse environmental and socio-economic effects. Any potential adverse residual effects 
and cumulative effects that may result from the Project are anticipated to be not significant.

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Project Overview 

NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL), a wholly owned subsidiary of TransCanada PipeLines Limited 
(TransCanada), is proposing to construct and operate the Cutbank River Lateral Loop No.2 (Pinto Creek 
Section) Pipeline and the Musreau Lake North Receipt Meter Station (meter station) (collectively, the 
Project). The Project is required to meet incremental producer requests for transportation of sweet natural 
gas from the northwest area of the NGTL Alberta System. The proposed pipeline will transport natural gas 
from the Cutbank River Lateral Loop system with a launching trap at NE 21-65-7 W6M (KP 32.3) to the 
Grande Prairie Mainline (dual tie-in) with receiving trap at NW 24-68-7 W6M (KP 0). A proposed 60 m 
x 60 m meter station, located at SE-26-62-6 W6M, is also included in the Project application (Figure 1.1).  

The Project will involve the construction of approximately 32 km of 610 mm O.D. (NPS 24) pipeline. The 
proposed Project will parallel NGTL’s existing and operational Cutbank River Lateral pipelines or other 
rights-of-way for approximately 78% of its length.  

The Project’s right-of-way will be 17 m wide where paralleling existing TransCanada rights-of-way and 27 m 
wide elsewhere. Additional areas for temporary workspace of varying width will be required at select 
locations along the entire length of the Project to accommodate construction activities (i.e., shoo-flies, log 
decks, construction office sites, staging areas, and material and pipe stockpile sites). Where feasible, 
existing highways, resource roads and the proposed right-of-way will be used to access the Project site. 
Valve sites are proposed to support the pipeline and are located entirely on previously disturbed 
right-of-way, adjacent to existing NGTL facilities. No camps are needed for construction and operation of 
the Project.  

NGTL commissioned TERA, a CH2M HILL Company (TERA) to prepare an Environmental and 
Socio-Economic Assessment (ESA) to satisfy the requirements of Section 58 of the National Energy Board 
(NEB) Act for approval of this Project. Subject to regulatory approvals, pipeline and meter station 
construction is scheduled to commence in Q4 2015 with a targeted in-service date of Q2 2016. 

Pursuant to Guide A.2.1 of the NEB Filing Manual, the level of detail contained in this report corresponds 
to the nature and magnitude of the anticipated environmental effects and has been prepared to meet NEB 
requirements for a Section 58 Application. An ESA checklist of the NEB Filing Manual requirements is 
provided in this ESA. In addition, the ESA has been prepared to meet the requirements of the NEB Online 
Application System guidance. 

All of the lands crossed by the proposed pipeline route and associated facilities are Crown-owned and lie 
within the Green Area of Alberta. The pipeline route is located in the Peace River Basin and crosses 
11 watercourses, including Bald Mountain Creek and its tributaries, and 28 nonfish-bearing drainages. The 
pipeline route crosses five wetland ecosystems, comprising approximately 2.8% (approximately 0.9 km) of 
the proposed route. 

Known reference points along the route are commonly referred to as Kilometre Post(s) (KP[s]). KPs are 
approximately 1 km apart and are primarily used to describe features along the pipeline route for 
construction, operation and maintenance purposes. 

A number of field studies (i.e., aquatics, wetlands, vegetation, wildlife, archaeology and traditional land use 
studies) were conducted for the Project. At this time, no further field studies are planned for the Project. 

• An aquatic assessment (Appendix 3) was prepared by TERA which includes the results of a winter 
aquatic habitat assessment in February 2014 and the results of an open water aquatic habitat 
assessment conducted from May 15 to 25, 2014 along the proposed pipeline route. The TERA field 
crew was joined by participants from Aseniwuche Winewak Nation of Canada, Horse Lake First Nation 
and Sturgeon Lake Cree Nation during the winter aquatic habitat assessment. Participants from 
Aseniwuche Winewak Nation of Canada, Nose Creek Settlement, Horse Lake First Nation, Kelly Lake 
Cree Nation, Kelly Lake Métis Settlement Society and the Métis Nation of Alberta Association Region 
6 joined the crew during the assessment in May 2014. There are no watercourses within 30 m of the 
proposed meter station site and therefore, field studies were not completed at this location. No further 
aquatics assessments are planned for the Project.

• A wetland evaluation (Appendix 4) was prepared by TERA which includes the results of a helicopter 
reconnaissance and helicopter supported ground-based wetland surveys conducted by TERA on 
June 18 and 19, 2014 along the proposed pipeline route. The surveys identified five wetland 
ecosystems crossed by the pipeline route, comprising approximately 2.8% of the length of the proposed 
pipeline route. Wetlands crossed include one basin bog (treed bog), one riparian swamp (mixedwood 
treed swamp), one flat swamp (shrubby swamp), one channel marsh (wet meadow) and one basin fen 
(shrubby fen). An additional wetland, a riparian marsh (seasonal emergent marsh), was identified 
approximately 25 m from KP 4.6 (SW 12-68-7 W6M); however, is not crossed by the pipeline route. 
The TERA field crew was joined by participants from Aseniwuche Winewak Nation of Canada, Horse 
Lake First Nation, Kelly Lake Cree Nation, Kelly Lake Métis Settlement Society and the Métis Nation of 
Alberta Association Region 6. There were no wetlands identified at the proposed meter station site and 
therefore, field studies were not completed at this location. There are no further wetland surveys 
planned for the Project.  

• A vegetation report (Appendix 5) was prepared by TERA which incorporates the results of a 
desktop/literature review and rare plant survey conducted on June 18 to 21, 2014 to identify potential 
rare plant species, rare non-vascular species (bryophytes and lichens) and rare ecological communities 
along the proposed route. In addition, forest pest infestations were documented and the state of 
late-successional forest identified in the desktop review was confirmed. No Committee on the Status of 
Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) or Species at Risk Act (SARA)-listed species were 
observed during the survey. No species designated under the Alberta Wildlife Act were observed during 
the survey along the pipeline or are known to occur at the meter station site. Three Alberta Conservation 
Information Management System (ACIMS)-listed rare vegetation species were observed during the 
rare vegetation survey along the proposed pipeline route. Several small Mountain Pine Beetle (MPB) 
infestations were noted during the vegetation survey along the proposed pipeline route. The meter 
station site is considered to have a low potential to support rare plants or rare ecological communities 
and therefore, field studies were not completed at this location. The TERA field crew was joined by 
participants from Aseniwuche Winewak Nation of Canada, Horse Lake First Nation, Kelly Lake Cree 
Nation, Kelly Lake Métis Settlement Society and the Métis Nation of Alberta Association Region 6.  

• A wildlife report (Appendix 6) was prepared by TERA which incorporates the results of a winter track 
survey that was conducted from February 13 to 18, 2014 and summer wildlife surveys that were 
conducted from June 16 to 22 and on June 28, 2014. A number of mammal, bird and amphibian species 
were observed during the wildlife survey along the proposed pipeline route and at the meter station 
location. No active or recently used mammal dens were identified along or immediately adjacent to the 
proposed pipeline right-of-way or meter station. An active northern flicker nesting cavity was observed 
adjacent to the existing right-of-way near KP 18.3. No active amphibian breeding ponds were identified. 
A beaver dam was observed at Bald Mountain Creek, approximately 280 m southeast (downstream) of 
the proposed pipeline crossing at KP 4.6. During the February 2014 surveys, TERA crews were joined 
by participants from Aseniwuche Winewak Nation of Canada, Horse Lake First Nation, Sturgeon Lake 
Cree Nation, Grande Cache Métis Local #1994, Kelly Lake Cree Nation, Kelly Lake First Nation and 
Kelly Lake Métis Settlement Society. During the June 2014 surveys, TERA crews were joined by 
participants from Aseniwuche Winewak Nation of Canada, Horse Lake First Nation, Kelly Lake Cree 
Nation, Kelly Lake Métis Settlement Society and the Métis Nation of Alberta Association Region 6. No 
further wildlife surveys are planned for the Project.  

• Alberta Culture and Tourism (ACT) has determined that a targeted Historical Resources Impact 
Assessment (HRIA) is warranted for this Project which incorporates the results of a site file search and 
field reconnaissance from June 24 to 26, 2014, August 4 to 9, 2014 and October 10 and 11, 2014. A 
final HRIA report outlining the results will be compiled and a recommendation for Historical Resources 
Act (HRA) clearance will be made to ACT based on these results. Confirmation of clearance from ACT 
under the HRA will be provided to the NEB prior to construction. Schedule B Requirements received 
from ACT for the Project are included in Appendix 7. During the June 2014 field survey, the TERA 
crews were joined by participants from Aseniwuche Winewak Nation of Canada, Horse Lake First 
Nation, Kelly Lake Cree Nation, Kelly Lake Métis Settlement Society and the Métis Nation of Alberta 
Association Region 6. No further historical resources assessment are planned for the Project at this 
time.

• A Traditional Knowledge (TK) Report (Appendix 8) was prepared by TERA which incorporates the 
results and recommendations of the Traditional Land Use (TLU) studies conducted along the route 
to-date and of the Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) collected through Aboriginal participation 
during the biophysical field studies for the Project. TERA initiated TEK studies with Aseniwuche 
Winewak Nation of Canada, Horse Lake First Nation, Grande Cache Métis Local #1994, Kelly Lake 
Cree Nation, Kelly Lake First Nation, Kelly Lake Métis Settlement Society, Nose Creek Settlement 
Society, Sturgeon Lake Cree Nation and Métis Nation of Alberta Association Region 6. Aboriginal 
perspectives shared during these studies have been integrated into this ESA and are included with the 
biophysical reports provided in Appendices 3 to 6, with issues and concerns integrated into this ESA. 
Engagement with Aboriginal communities is ongoing. NGTL will continue to engage Aboriginal 
communities through all phases of the Project. Ongoing TLU study work with participating Aboriginal 
communities is scheduled for completion prior to construction of the Project and will be incorporated 
into a supplemental TK Report and forwarded to the NEB in Q1 2015. Information gathered during 
ongoing TLU studies and engagement will be considered for incorporation into Project planning 
(including the Environmental Protection Plan [EPP] and the Environmental Alignment Sheets) and 
forwarded to the NEB, as appropriate.

1.2 Project Justification 

The Project is needed to meet incremental producer requests for transportation of sweet natural gas from 
the northwest area of the NGTL Alberta System. 

1.3 Scope of the Project 

The scope of the Project includes the activities and components needed to carry out the Project and allow 
it to proceed (NEB 2014a). This combination of activities and components include: 

• construction of a pipeline; 

• construction of two valve sites associated with the pipeline; 

• construction of a meter station facility including one new permanent access road and 
valve site; 

• use of existing infrastructure (e.g., rights-of-way, access roads); and 

• use of temporary facilities (e.g., construction office sites, pipe stockpile sites, equipment 
storage sites). 

1.4 Scope of the Assessment 

Scoping is the process of identifying the physical works and activities to include within the ESA, and what 
biophysical and socio-economic elements are likely to be affected. Proper scoping reduces the risk of 
including unimportant or irrelevant information in the assessment or excluding factors that should be 
assessed (NEB 2014a). This environmental assessment takes into account the factors listed in the NEB 
Filing Manual (NEB 2014a) as well as pertinent issues and concerns identified through regulatory, 
stakeholder and public consultation, and Aboriginal engagement. 

The environmental assessment considers the following factors:  

• the environmental effects of the Project, including the environmental effects of 
malfunctions or accidents that may occur in connection with the Project and any 
cumulative environmental effects that are likely to result from the Project in combination 
with other projects or activities that have been or will be carried out; 

• the significance of the above effects; 

• comments from the general public, stakeholders or other land users; 

• measures that are technically and economically feasible which would mitigate any 
significant adverse environmental or socio-economic effects of the Project; and 

• any other matter relevant to the assessment, such as the need for the Project that the 
NEB may require to be considered. 

The environmental assessment considers the potential effects of the Project on the environment in the 
context of defined spatial and temporal boundaries. These boundaries will vary with the issues and 
environmental elements or interactions to be considered, and will reflect: 

• the construction, operation, maintenance and decommissioning phases of the proposed 
physical works and physical activities; 

• the natural variation of a population, or ecological or socio-economic component; 

• the timing of sensitive life cycle phases in relation to the scheduling of the proposed 
physical works and physical activities;

• the time required for an effect to become evident; 

• the time required for a population or ecological or socio-economic component to recover 
from an effect and return to a pre-effect condition; 

• the area directly affected by proposed physical works and physical activities; and 

• the area in which a population or ecological or socio-economic component functions and 
within which a Project effect may be felt. 

The spatial boundaries for this ESA considered one or more of the following study areas. 

• The Project Footprint (Footprint) is made up of the area directly disturbed by pipeline construction 
and clean-up activities, including associated physical works and activities (i.e., construction right-of-way 
and temporary workspace during construction; valve sites; and permanent meter station including valve 
site and access road). 

• A Local Study Area (LSA) that varies with the environment and resource use related socio-economic 
element being considered. For each element considered, the LSA is established based on the zone of 
influence (ZOI) within which plants, animals and humans are most likely to be affected by pipeline 
construction and operation. The LSA is introduced in Section 5.0 and detailed discussions regarding 
the LSA and associated rationale for each element are provided in Sections 6.2. For social elements 
(e.g., Human Occupancy and Resource Use [HORU]), local potential effects are related to specific 
communities considered in the socio-economic assessment. The communities considered were based 
on whether there would be direct potential effects, such as a physical, social or economic interaction 
between the Project and the community or community residents and their economic, social or cultural 
resources and pursuits. Communities considered in the ESA are described in Section 5.0 and listed in 
Table 6.1.  

• A Regional Study Area (RSA) that consists of the area extending beyond the LSA boundary and varies 
with the environment and resource use related socio-economic element (e.g., TEK, infrastructure and 
services) being considered. For each element considered, a separate spatial RSA boundary was 
established in consideration of the regional effects of the Project on the individual element. The RSA is 
introduced in Section 5.0 and further rationale for the establishment of the Project RSAs for each 
element is provided in Section 6.2. 

• An International Area extending beyond Canada. 

Reconnaissance and detailed field studies, as well as desktop studies considered known areas where 
temporary workspace is expected to be necessary. In the event an area of interest was identified (e.g., rare 
plant or wildlife feature), field crews expanded their survey, if appropriate and where allowed (no greater 
than the LSA), to identify the extent and distribution of the area of interest and ensure a comprehensive 
assessment of the environmental feature(s) being surveyed. 

The environmental assessment also considered cumulative effects that are likely to result from the Project 
in combination with existing activities and reasonable foreseeable developments that have been or will be 
carried out.

2.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
This section describes and identifies the purpose, alternatives means, location, footprint, components and 
phases of the Project. Figure 1.1 (see Section 1.0) provides an overview map of the Project and Figure 1.2 
provides a map of the meter station site components. 

2.1 Project Purpose 

The Project will meet increasing demand for transportation of sweet natural gas along the existing NGTL 
Alberta System. Although the proposed meter station is located approximately 30 km southwest of the 
proposed pipeline route, both Project components are required to support increasing customer demand. 
The pipeline and meter station are required on the same existing pipeline system to provide additional 
capacity.  

2.2 Alternative Means 

Alternative means are the various ways that are technically and economically feasible to implement and 
carry out the Project (CEA Agency 2013a). Since only buried pipeline options realistically meet the Project 
need and purpose and this has been considered the most economical option to increase capacity on the 
existing system, and no existing pipelines provide a feasible alternative for transportation between the 
various tie-in points. For this Project, alternative means considered include routing and watercourse 
crossing construction techniques, discussed further in Section 4.0.  

2.3 Location of the Project 

The Project is located in a forested setting within the Municipal District of Greenview No. 16 (MD of 
Greenview). All lands traversed are Crown-owned and the proposed route lies within the Green Area of 
Alberta. The Project is located approximately 30 km south/southwest of the City of Grande Prairie (Grande 
Prairie). The proposed Project will loop NGTL’s existing and operational Cutbank River Lateral Loop (Bald 
Mountain Section) which was constructed in 2010, paralleling existing or approved linear dispositions for 
approximately 78% of its length. Additionally, the proposed Musreau Lake North Receipt Meter Station is 
required to support the Project located at SE 26-62-6 W6M.  

2.4 Project Components 

The proposed location and technical details of the components of the Project are summarized in Table 2.1. 

Construction equipment will travel along the proposed right-of-way and access the route via existing access 
roads. Design, construction and operation of the Project will be in compliance with all applicable codes, 
standards and regulations. Subject to regulatory approval, construction is scheduled to commence in 
November 2015.

Technical Component Project Details 
Construction Right-of-Way 
Width and Temporary 
Workspace: 

The construction right-of-way will be 27 m wide and 17 m wide when paralleling 
existing TransCanada rights-of-way, with additional temporary workspace 
(varying width) along the entire route for soil handling and material laydown 
areas. Temporary workspace will also be needed at road, foreign pipeline, utility 
and drainage feature crossings, as well as at sharp sidebends and tie-ins. 

Access Road: Approximately 270 m x 10 m located at SE 26-62-6 W6M 
Meter Station: 60 m x 60 m located at SE 26-62-6 W6M 
Valve Sites:  Located at NE 21-65-7 W6M, NW 24-68-7 W6M and SE 26-62-6 W6M 
Minimum Depth of Cover: 0.9 m  
Minimum Depth of Cover at 
Watercourses with a Defined 
Bank 

1.5 m 

Typical Trench Width: Approximately 1.4 m  
Test Medium: Water or methanol mix 
Construction Schedule: November 2015 to March 2016 
Length of Construction: 20 to 22 weeks (pipeline) and 3 weeks (facility site) 
Expected Useful Life of 
Project: 

Over 40 years 

2.5 Project Footprint 

Pipeline Right-of-Way  
In order to accommodate construction activities, vehicle and equipment movement and safe transportation 
of personnel, the construction right-of-way will be 17 m wide where paralleling existing TransCanada 
rights-of-way (i.e., using 10 m from existing rights-of-way) and 27 m wide elsewhere. The total right-of-way 
width is 27 m along the entire proposed route. In addition to the pipeline construction right-of-way, 
temporary workspace will be required at select locations to accommodate construction activities, staging 
areas, stockpile sites, construction offices, crossings (e.g., roads, pipelines, utilities and watercourses with 
defined banks), pipeline bends, and timber storage. The Project will parallel existing easements as often 
as practical. Where the route parallels existing easements, agreements have been sought to temporarily 
overlap these easements during construction to reduce the amount of “new” right-of-way needed. This 
temporary construction right-of-way overlap must typically maintain a safety buffer distance from existing 
pipelines. Therefore, the location of adjacent pipelines within existing easements and the necessary buffer 
zone constitute the amount of temporary construction overlap of any existing right-of-way. Two additional 
valve sites located at NE 21-65-7 W6M and NW 24-68-7 W6M are needed for the proposed pipeline tie-in 
locations. The total land Footprint needed to construct the pipeline component of the Project is 
approximately 114 ha, of which approximately 69.6 ha is pipeline right-of-way, 0.2 ha is attributed to the 
valve sites and 44.2 ha is attributed to temporary workspace. At Bald Mountain Creek (WC1) the 
contingency plan is an isolated open-cut pipeline crossing method which will result in an additional 3.8 ha 
of land to be used during construction. 

Meter Station Site 
The permanent meter station site will be located at SE 26-62-6 W6M. One new permanent access road, 
valve site and pipeline tie-in will be constructed to support the operation of the meter station. The meter 
station includes a 60 m x 60 m site that will include a fenced and graveled area to contain the meter station 
infrastructure (Figure 1.2). The total land footprint needed for the meter station is approximately 0.87 ha, 
including: 0.36 ha for the fenced meter station; 0.07 ha for the valve site; 0.15 ha for the pipeline tie-in 
right-of-way; and 0.28 ha for the access road.

2.6 Construction 

2.6.1 Pipeline Installation 

The total length of pipeline to be installed for the Project is approximately 32 km. Pipeline construction will 
involve the following standard activities: engineering; construction surveying; clearing and disposal of 
vegetation; strippings salvage; grading (where warranted); stringing; bending and welding; trenching; 
lowering-in; backfilling; hydrostatic testing; clean-up/reclamation; watercourse and wetland crossings; and 
pipeline integrity and validation. These activities are presented in Table 2.2 in the order of occurrence during 
construction.

PIPELINE CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES  

Pipeline Construction Phase Associated Activities 
Engineering The pipeline will be designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable 

Canadian Standards Association (CSA) standards and the NEB OPRs. 
Construction Survey Activities include line-of-sight flagging and staking of the boundaries of the 

construction right-of-way, temporary workspace as well as marking the trench 
line and existing utilities. Avoidance areas will be appropriately fenced or 
flagged, where warranted. 

Clearing Vegetation (grasses, timber, stumps, brush and other woody vegetation) and 
snow will be mowed or cleared from the construction right-of-way and temporary 
workspace. Non-salvageable vegetative debris will be disposed of or otherwise 
handled. Typical equipment used for clearing activities includes chain saws, 
rotary grinders, feller-bunchers, hydro-axes, mulchers or other tree-clearing 
equipment, as well as skidders, dozers and backhoes. Rollback will be saved 
where possible. A stump mulcher will be utilized rather than grubbing on areas 
where strippings salvage and grading is not necessary. 

Disposal Vegetative debris that is not salvaged for merchantability will be disposed of 
through burning or mechanical chipping/mulching. Burning will be conducted 
following the Forest Protection Regulations (Alberta Reg. 310/72). If timber and 
brush are disposed of by mechanical means (i.e., mulching or chipping), the 
activities will be carried out according to Alberta Environment and Sustainable 
Resource Development (AESRD) Industry Directive ID 1009-01 (Management of 
Wood Chips on Public Land). Typical equipment used during disposal includes 
mulchers, chainsaw, chippers and trucks. 

Strippings Handling Strippings will be salvaged at areas where grading is necessary. The area 
stripped is to correspond to the area to be graded. The width and depth of 
strippings salvage depends on a number of factors including: the soil conditions 
at the time of construction; microtopography; and grading requirements. Typical 
equipment used during strippings handling activities includes dozers, graders 
and backhoes. 

Grading Following strippings salvage, grading will be conducted on irregular ground 
surfaces (including temporary workspace), if necessary, to provide a safe work 
surface. Graders, backhoes and dozers may be used for this activity. 

Stringing, Bending and 
Welding 

The pipe will be bent, lined-up, welded, joint-coated and inspected prior to being 
lowered into the trench. Typical equipment used includes pipe trucks, booms, 
bending machines, pick-up trucks, and x-ray or ultrasonic inspection equipment 
mounted on pick-up trucks or skids. 

Trenching The trench will be excavated using tracked excavators or wheel ditchers to a 
depth sufficient to ensure the depth of cover is in accordance or in excess of 
applicable codes. The minimum depth of cover will be 0.9 m and a minimum of 
1.5 m at watercourses with defined bed and banks. A scour analysis at 
watercourse crossings will be completed to confirm the depth of cover meets the 
1:100 year scour depth.

TABLE 2.2  Cont'd 

Pipeline Construction Phase Associated Activities 
Lowering-In Welded pipe sections will be lowered into the trench by sideboom tractors and/or 

backhoes. Trench dewatering may be needed prior to lowering-in the welded 
pipe to prevent the pipe from floating or for performing tie-in welds. Buoyancy 
control may be installed with the pipe in wetland areas or areas with a high water 
table. 

Watercourse and Wetland 
Crossings 

The preferred pipeline method at all watercourse crossings is a trenchless HDD. 
At Bald Mountain Creek (WC1) the contingency plan is an isolated open-cut 
pipeline crossing method (see Section 4.0).  

Backfilling Prior to backfilling, subsurface erosion control structures such as ditch plugs will 
be installed along with subdrains, where warranted, to control subsurface 
drainage along the trench. The trench will be backfilled using backhoes, graders, 
dozers or specialized backfilling equipment. Backfill material will generally 
consist of native trench spoil material. All available spoil will be crowned over the 
trench line to allow for settlement. Openings will be left in the crown at 
appropriate locations to allow for temporary and permanent cross right-of-way 
drainage. 

Testing All pipe will be hydrostatically pressure tested and adhere to industry standards 
as well as relevant provincial and federal regulations. Typical equipment used 
during testing includes air compressors, test heads, fill line, water trucks and 
pumps. 

Clean-Up and Reclamation Upon completion of construction activities, clean-up and reclamation procedures 
will be initiated using dozers, backhoes and/or graders. Garbage or debris 
remaining on-site will be removed and disposed of in compliance with local 
regulations. The pipeline right-of-way will be graded to restore pre-construction 
contours, where practical. 
The proposed pipeline easement will be returned to a stable condition. The 
strippings will be replaced, with cross ditches and diversion berms installed on 
moderate slopes to reduce the risk of erosion. On areas where erosion is not 
expected, natural revegetation will be the preferred method of reclamation.  

Pipeline Integrity Validation 
and Testing 

NGTL will validate the integrity of the new pipeline through CSA and/or 
NEB-approved methods prior to commissioning the pipeline using 
non-destructive examination and hydrostatic tests when the pipeline is filled with 
water to a pressure beyond normal daily operating pressures. 

 

Permanent above ground piping for the pipeline component is limited to tie-in locations at the proposed 
pipeline valve site located adjacent to an existing valve site at NE 21-65-7 W6M and the proposed valve 
site located adjacent to an existing valve site at NW 24-68-7 W6M (Table 2.1). All Project components will 
be installed within the proposed pipeline right-of-way boundaries and approved Department Pipeline Lease 
(DPL) Crown dispositions. Permanent valve sites for the Project will be located adjacent to the proposed 
Musreau Lake No. 2 Meter Station site.  

2.6.2 Meter Station and Permanent Access Road Construction 

Activities associated with the installation of the proposed meter station are typical to those involved in 
constructing a facility site on forested lands during frozen conditions and include: surveying; salvaging of 
strippings; grading; hydrovacing to confirm existing below ground utility locations; welding to the valve for 
the mainline tie-in; welding and x-ray inspection of all pipeline welds on the yard piping; erecting a fence 
around the perimeter of the site; gravelling work areas within the meter station boundary; clean-up; and 
revegetation of non-gravelled disturbed areas.  

The type of equipment to be used during construction of the proposed meter station may include: 
excavators; bulldozers; backhoes; a pile driver; hydrovac trucks; pickers; and pick-up trucks and welder 
trucks.

The resulting fenced and gravelled area will measure approximately 60 m x 60 m and will include: 
building(s); above ground piping; and instrumentation and telecommunication enclosures mounted on 
posts. There will be one valve site located outside of the northeast fenceline of the prosed meter station 
site. One new permanent access road is proposed. 

Design, construction and operation of the proposed meter station will be in compliance with all applicable 
codes, standards and regulations. 

2.6.3 Inspection 

NGTL will retain the services of a qualified Environmental Inspector(s) during all critical phases of 
construction of the Project (Section 8.0). The Environmental Inspector(s) will monitor construction activities 
and ensure the implementation of protection measures outlined in NGTL's documentation, including the 
EPP (Appendix 1) and the Environmental Alignment Sheets (Appendix 2) developed for the Project. 

2.6.4 Estimated Workforce Requirements 

Construction of the Project will involve a workforce of up to 450 workers. The skills of the anticipated 
workforce will include heavy equipment operators, welders, labourers, teamsters, mechanics, foremen, 
surveyors, inspectors and field office support personnel. No new permanent, part-time or full-time jobs will 
be directly created by the Project. 

2.6.5 Environmental Permits/Approvals 

The potential environmental permits and/or authorizations that are to be obtained prior to construction 
activities are outlined in Table 2.3.

2.6.6 Construction Schedule 

Pipeline construction activities are progressive commencing with survey and right-of-way preparation and 
continuing through pipe stringing, welding, pipe inspection, trenching, lowering-in, backfilling, clean-up and 
reclamation. These activities are performed sequentially and move along the construction right-of-way in a 
south to north direction. The average duration crews will be working at a given location on the proposed 
construction right-of-way is approximately 1 month. Areas that will take longer are tie-in locations, which 
are routinely completed and tested last. Testing will be conducted following installation of the pipeline. 
Pipeline construction activities are expected to occur over a 12 to 16 week period (see Table 2.4).  

Meter station construction activities are expected to occur over a short period of time and will be conducted 
concurrently for approximately 3 weeks (Table 2.4)

2.7 Operation and Maintenance 

TransCanada operates the NGTL Alberta System pursuant to an Operating Agreement between 
TransCanada and NGTL. TransCanada applies corporate policies in its operations of the NGTL System 
that are common to TransCanada’s operation of other federally-regulated pipelines. For the Project, 
TransCanada will develop and implement a Post-Construction Environmental Monitoring Program to 
assess the effectiveness of mitigation and reclamation measures on soils, vegetation, watercourses and 
wetlands disturbed during construction of the pipeline. TransCanada will conduct monitoring and prepare 
maintenance plans and quality assurance/control programs to address any potential adverse environmental 
effects.

TransCanada has systems in place to manage the safe operation and integrity of its existing pipelines and 
facilities. These programs will be expanded to include the Project. The new pipeline will have specific 
integrity management plans ensuring that the ongoing requirements of this pipeline are met through its 
service life. Internal inspection is an integral part of the TransCanada Canadian Gas Pipeline Integrity 
Management Program and the proposed in-line inspection facilities will be designed to allow passage of 
various types of in-line inspection including cleaning tools and high and low resolution in-line inspection 
tools. 

TransCanada has operation procedures that describe how its pipelines are operated and maintained. The 
manual provides detailed information on right-of-way maintenance including information on Alberta 
One-Call, aerial reconnaissance, pipeline crossings, road usage, pipeline signage, brush control and weed 
control. This manual will be expanded to include work completed for the Project. 

2.8 Decommissioning or Abandonment 

The Project has been designed to operate for 40 years or more. Decommissioning or abandonment 
activities will comply with all applicable federal and provincial regulatory requirements. Any 
decommissioning or abandonment activities will require the approval of the NEB and other applicable 
agencies. These approvals will be applied for at the time of decommissioning planning. Decommissioning 
or abandonment are discussed further in Section 6.4.

3.0 COMMUNITY AND REGULATORY CONSULTATION AND ABORIGINAL 
ENGAGEMENT 

3.1 Introduction 

Consultation was initiated by NGTL in the early planning phases of the Project. NGTL worked with AESRD 
to acquire land easements and will continue to work closely with stakeholders and Aboriginal groups to 
identify and address concerns that may arise about the Project. Aboriginal perspectives shared during 
biophysical field studies are included in Appendices 3 to 6. Any potential issues or concerns to date have 
been addressed in this ESA. 

NGTL worked independently and in collaboration with TERA to consult with government agencies as well 
as local communities to collect information for incorporation into the ESA. Consultation and engagement 
provides those who could be affected by the Project with the opportunity to participate in the ESA. NGTL is 
committed to building long-term relationships with the communities within which it operates, and recognizes 
and respects the rights of stakeholders, Aboriginal culture and the importance of land. NGTL believes that 
consultation develops mutual trust and helps to build co-operative working relationships. The goal of these 
programs is to share information about the plans and activities of the Project. TERA is committed to 
assisting NGTL in achieving these objectives. 

3.2 Consultation and Engagement Objectives and Methods 

3.2.1 Consultation and Engagement Objectives 

The objectives of consultation were to: 

• share information about the Project, the proponent and the regulatory process;  

• obtain feedback on the potential effects of the Project; and 

• obtain input from federal and provincial regulatory agencies on the Project design and 
ESA requirements. 

The Consultation and Engagement sections of the NEB Application for the Project provide a summary of 
public involvement activities conducted in association with the preparation of this ESA including consultation 
with federal, provincial and municipal government agencies, and engagement with Aboriginal communities 
and other interested parties, where applicable. Key environmental and socio-economic issues raised during 
the consultation and engagement program are discussed in the relevant sections of the ESA. The 
consultation and engagement conducted in association with the preparation of this ESA was designed to 
complement the NGTL consultation program.  

3.2.2 Consultation and Engagement Outcomes 

The results of the consultation and engagement processes have helped refine the ESA for the Project. With 
this information, NGTL identified issues, addressed concerns and responded to questions. Engagement 
has also provided Aboriginal groups, communities and government with an understanding of the potential 
effects of the Project. 

Results of the consultation and engagement have been considered and incorporated throughout the ESA, 
where relevant, including the effects assessment and mitigation measures. 

3.3 Community and Stakeholder Engagement 

NGTL identified stakeholders potentially affected by the Project including AESRD, Alberta Culture (now 
ACT), Environment Canada and the MD of Greenview. Starting on May 1, 2014, stakeholders received an 
information package including:  

• Project schedule and general information;

• a Fact Sheet and Cover letter; 

• NEB Brochure: A Pipeline or Power Line Near You; 

• Aboriginal Relations & Stakeholder Relations Brochure; 

• Your Safety, Our Integrity; and  

• NGTL’s Stakeholder Engagement Commitment Statement. 

Project updates (i.e., construction schedules and component updates) were communicated with 
stakeholders accordingly throughout summer 2014. To date, no concerns regarding the Project have been 
raised.  

3.4 Aboriginal Engagement 

NGTL’s list of which Aboriginal communities may be potentially affected by the Project is developed through 
a combination of desktop research, NGTL’s own operating experience in the region and NGTL’s established 
contacts with Aboriginal communities. The Aboriginal engagement process, guided by TransCanada’s 
Aboriginal Relations Policy, helped identify communities with a potential interest in the Project. Starting in 
August 2014, NGTL sent the same information package (listed above) to notify the following communities 
of the Project:  

• Horse Lake First Nation; 

• Sturgeon Lake Cree Nation; 

• Nose Creek Settlement; 

• Kelly Lake Cree Nation; 

• Kelly Lake First Nation; 

• Kelly Lake Métis Settlement Society; 

• Aseniwuche Winewak Nation of Canada;  

• Grande Cache Métis Local #1994; 

• Grande Prairie Métis Local #1990; 

• Métis Nation of Alberta;  

• Métis Nation of Alberta Association Region 4; and 

• Métis Nation of Alberta Association Region 6. 

In 2014, TEK was gathered and recorded with community members of Aseniwuche Winewak Nation of 
Canada, Horse Lake First Nation, Grande Cache Métis Local #1994, Kelly Lake Cree Nation, Kelly Lake 
First Nation, Kelly Lake Métis Settlement Society, Nose Creek Settlement Society, Sturgeon Lake Cree 
Nation and Métis Nation of Alberta Association Region 6 during the biophysical field studies for the Project 
(Table 2-1 of Appendix 8). TLU information for the Project has been collected and shared to date by Horse 
Lake First Nation, Nose Creek Settlement and Aseniwuche Winewak Nation of Canada, and can be found 
in the TK Report (Appendix 8). Sturgeon Lake Cree Nation, Kelly Lake Cree Nation, Grande Prairie Métis 
Local #1990, Grande Cache Métis Local #1994, Métis Nation of Alberta Association Region 4 and Métis 
Nation of Alberta Association Region 6 are currently conducting third-party TLU reports for the Project, the 
results of which will be provided to the NEB in a supplemental filing in Q1 2015. Kelly Lake First Nation and 
Kelly Lake Métis Settlement Society have elected not to participate in TLU studies for the Project.

4.0 ROUTE SELECTION 
4.1 Control Points 

The primary routing control points for the proposed pipeline are identified as follows. 

• Tie-in at the proposed pipeline valve site (source control point): located adjacent to an existing valve 
site at NE 21-65-7 W6M. 

• Tie-in at the proposed pipeline valve site (delivery control point): located near an existing valve site at 
NW 24-68-7 W6M. 

4.2 Routing Considerations 

NGTL’s routing selection is governed by the control points as established by system design requirements. 
Following the identification of the control points, other various routing considerations are taken into account. 
Since the Project is a looping project to expand capacity, a primary routing consideration is the placement 
adjacent to existing facilities, however, the routing process is progressive and the geotechnical results will 
confirm the final route design of the proposed Project. 

The routing strategy was to install the pipeline parallel and adjacent to existing rights-of-way, where 
feasible. As a result, 78% (approximately 25 km) of the proposed pipeline route parallels existing 
disturbances (i.e., roads, facility sites, cutlines). Other considerations are listed below, in no particular order, 
and include:  

• identification of watercourse crossing locations that are geotechnically stable and where 
more than one construction installation method is possible (e.g., contingency directional 
drilling or trenched crossing); 

• limiting the length of the pipeline crossing Environmentally Sensitive Areas such as 
protected, Endangered or sensitive vegetation and wildlife habitat; 

• reducing the number of watercourse crossings, where feasible; 

• complying with applicable regulatory requirements; 

• avoiding identified socially and culturally important areas such as parks, natural areas, 
TLU sites (e.g., Indian Reserves, historic sites, heritage sites, cemeteries, etc.); 

• following or using existing clearings, where feasible; 

• crossing all roads at or as close to right angles as possible; 

• considering construction difficulty and associated costs; 

• using the shortest route practical; and 

• limiting conflicts with existing land and resource uses. 

The routing strategy was to install the pipeline parallel and adjacent to existing rights-of-way, where 
feasible. As a result, 78% (approximately 25 km) of the proposed route parallels existing linear infrastructure 
with 55% (approximately 17 km) paralleling existing NGTL rights-of-way and the remaining 23% 
(approximately 5 km) paralleling other linear infrastructure. NGTL's preliminary route options were reviewed 
by aerial reconnaissance in February 2014 and by ground in June and July of 2014. Reconnaissance of 
the proposed route involved project management, construction management, survey, and environmental 
personnel.

Page 4-2 
 
 

Environmental disciplines conducting field work in 2014 assessed the route for environmental concerns 
while considering the constraints of the source and delivery points as well as the routing considerations 
noted above. No route realignments resulted from the biophysical surveys. Diversions from existing 
disturbances were warranted due to existing industrial dispositions, to cross watercourses at straight 
reaches and for constructability. 

4.2.1 Watercourse Crossings 

The preferred pipeline crossing method at Bald Mountain Creek (WC1) is a trenchless HDD, while the 
contingency is an isolated open-cut pipeline crossing method. The contingency pipeline crossing method 
at Bald Mountain Creek is an isolated open-cut pipeline crossing method and will be implemented only if 
the preferred trenchless pipeline crossing method is unsuccessful or not feasible. The contingency crossing 
location (WC1-A) on Bald Mountain Creek is at the same location as the preferred crossing location. 
However, the alignment of the contingency pipeline route for the contingency crossing has been adjusted 
to cross Bald Mountain Creek perpendicular to the watercourse for instream construction. Bald Mountain 
Creek will most likely have water present at the time of construction based on the water conditions recorded 
during the winter aquatic habitat investigations (i.e., February 2014), open water aquatic assessments 
(i.e., June/July 2010 and May 2014) and the 2011 winter construction of the paralleling Cutbank Lateral 
Loop (Bald Mountain Section) Pipeline Project (TERA Environmental Consultants 2010a and 2011a).Based 
on the results of the open water aquatic habitat assessment, these crossings are considered to have low 
sensitivity during construction if the mitigation and reclamation measures outlined in Appendix 3 are 
implemented.

5.0 ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC SETTING 
Table 5.1 describes the environmental and socio-economic setting along the proposed pipeline route and 
at the meter station based on the spatial boundaries described in Sections 1.4 and 6.2. Environmental and 
socio-economic baseline information is provided for the general Project area, followed by 
component-specific (i.e., for the pipeline and meter station) information. In addition, select environmental 
information is provided on the Environmental Alignment Sheets (Appendix 2). Information collected for the 
setting was obtained from existing literature and internet searches, all of which are cited in Section 11.0, 
along with applicable PCM Report results from the Cutbank River Lateral Loop (Bald Mountain Section) 
Pipeline Project. In addition, the results of the aquatics, wetlands, vegetation, wildlife and TEK/TLU 
supporting studies are summarized in Table 5.1. Methodologies for the aquatic assessment, wetland 
evaluation, vegetation survey, wildlife studies and the collection of TEK are included in Appendices 3 to 6 
and 8, respectively.  

TABLE 5.1 
 

SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC ELEMENTS AND CONSIDERATIONS 

Environmental and 
Socio-Economic 

Elements Summary of Considerations 
Physical and Meteorological Environment 
Study Area • The Physical and Meteorological Environment LSA is defined as the ZOI likely to be 

affected by terrain instability during construction and operation of the Project. It 
consists of a 1 km wide band centred on the proposed pipeline route centre line 
(i.e., 500 m on both sides of the centre line) and 500 m around the perimeter of the 
meter station to incorporate effects that may extend off the Footprint (e.g., water 
erosion on slopes) (Figure 6.1). Potential effects are not anticipated to extend beyond 
the Physical Environment LSA and, therefore, a Physical Environment RSA has not 
been established. 

General • The general topography of the area is characterized by rolling uplands and foothills, 
and dissected plateaus (Natural Regions Committee 2006).  

• The Project is not located in an area that is subject to permafrost formation (Natural 
Resources Canada [NRCan] 2009a). 

• The Project does not encounter any areas with recorded occurrences of ground 
instability (NRCan 2009b-e) or where there has been a major flood event 
(AESRD 2012a, NRCan 2009f). There are no Protective Notations (PNT) pertaining to 
instability or erosion along the proposed pipeline route (Alberta Energy 2014a). 

• No major tornadoes or hail storms have been recorded in the Physical and 
Meteorological Environment LSA (NRCan 2009g,h). 

Pipeline • From KP 0 to approximately KP 9.5, the pipeline route is located within the Wapiti 
Plains Section of the Southern Alberta Uplands Physiographic Region of Alberta, 
where elevations range from 600 to 900 m above sea level. The remainder of the 
pipeline route (approximately KP 9.5 to KP 32.3) is located within the Grande Cache 
Benchlands Section of the Southern Alberta Uplands Physiographic Region of Alberta, 
where elevations range from 750 to 1,500 m above sea level (Pettapiece 1986).  

• The pipeline route is underlain by the Upper Cretaceous and Paleogene-aged 
Coalspur Formation and the Wapiti Formation (upper). The Upper Cretaceous and 
Paleogene-aged Coalspur Formation is non-marine in nature and is characterized by: 
sandstone (thin-bedded to massive), siltstone, mudstone and coal; subordinate 
conglomerate and bentonite; thick coal seams occur locally; and the extent is poorly 
defined in some areas (Prior et al. 2013). The Wapiti Formation is characterized by 
siltstone and mudstone with subordinate sandstone (thin to thick bedded) coal, and 
bentonite with fluvial and lacustrine deposits (Prior et al. 2013).  

• Results from the First-Year PCM Program for the Cutbank River Lateral Loop (Bald 
Mountain Section) Pipeline Project indicate subsidence was observed in eight 
quarter-sections along the right-of-way (TERA 2013a). In follow-up with the NEB, 
NGTL determined the subsidence was not compromising the overall reclamation 
success of the area, and was not creating risk to the integrity of the pipeline, the public, 
wildlife or other valued environmental resources (TERA 2013a).

Elements Summary of Considerations 
Pipeline (cont’d) • NRCan considers the risk of wind erosion along the pipeline route to be moderate, 

based on local climate and vegetation (NRCan 2009i). 
• NRCan considered the lands surrounding the Project to have a high to very high fire 

danger rating based on factors including the ease of a fire starting and spreading, the 
difficulty of control, and the resulting impacts based on an assessment of ignition risk, 
the fire environment (e.g., fuels, weather, and topography) and values at risk 
(NRCan 2009j). There have been no recent forest fires (i.e., in the last 40 years) along 
the proposed pipeline route (AESRD 2014a). Project activities are scheduled to 
commence during winter 2015 (see Table 2.4). 

• From KP 0 to KP 16.8, the pipeline route is located in the Central Mixedwood 
Subregion of the Boreal Natural Region of Alberta where the climate is characterized 
by short, warm summers and long, cold winters (Natural Regions Committee 2006). 
The remainder of the route is located in the Foothills Natural Region. Within the 
Foothills Natural Region, the pipeline route is located in the Lower Foothills Subregion 
from KP 16.8 to KP 29.6 and the Upper Foothills Subregion from KP 29.6 to KP 32.3. 
The climate of the Upper Foothills Natural Subregion is characterized by short, wet 
summers and snowy, cold winters, while the Lower Foothills Natural Subregion 
represents a climatic transition area with cold winters typical of Boreal climates and 
higher winter snowfalls typical of Cordilleran climates (Natural Regions 
Committee 2006). The Upper Foothills Natural Subregion is, on average, cooler 
year-round than the Lower Foothills Natural Subregion, with cooler summers and 
slightly warmer winters, a shorter growing season, and heavier summer and winter 
precipitation (Natural Regions Committee 2006).  

• The proposed route parallels existing linear disturbance for approximately 78% of its 
length. 

• The following meteorological data were obtained from an Environment Canada 
meteorological station in Grande Prairie, Alberta between 1981 and 2010 (Environment 
Canada 2013). The data were taken approximately 30 km north of the proposed 
pipeline route. 
− The average total annual rainfall for Grande Prairie is 322.4 mm. The average 

monthly rainfall is 26.9 mm and the average monthly rainfall from June to August is 
69.24 mm. In August of 1994, Grande Prairie recorded its highest daily rainfall of 
90.0 mm, which is above the monthly average of 55.7 mm for August. 

− The average total annual snowfall for Grande Prairie is 154.3 cm. The average 
monthly snowfall is 12.9 cm and the average monthly snowfall from November to 
February is 26.5 cm. In October of 1957, Grande Prairie recorded its highest daily 
snowfall of 36.3 cm, well above the 12.0 cm average for the month of October. 

− The average daily temperature for Grande Prairie is 2.2°C, with the warmest month 
in July, averaging 16.2°C and the coolest month in January, and averaging -13.6°C. 
In July of 2006, Grande Prairie experienced its warmest day of 35.6°C and in 
January of 1950, experienced its coolest day at -52.2°C. 

Meter Station • The proposed Musreau Lake North Receipt Meter Station is located approximately 
30 km southeast of KP 32.3. The meter station is located within the Grande Cache 
Benchlands Section of the Southern Alberta Uplands Physiographic Region of Alberta, 
where elevations range from 750 to 1,500 m above sea level (Pettapiece 1986). 

• The meter station is underlain by the Paleogene-aged Paskapoo Formation. The 
Paskapoo Formation is non-marine in nature and is characterized by grey to 
greenish-grey mudstone and siltstone with subordinate pale grey, thick to thin-bedded, 
commonly cross-stratified sandstone, minor conglomerate, mollusc coquina and coal 
(Prior et al. 2013). 

• The meter station is located in the Upper Foothills Natural Subregion of the Foothills 
Natural region of Alberta (Natural Regions Committee 2006). 

• NRCan considers the risk of wind erosion in the general area of the Project to be 
negligible and, therefore, it is not rated on a relative risk scale (NRCan 2009i).

• As noted, NRCan considered the lands surrounding the Project to have a high to very 
high fire danger rating based on factors including the ease of a fire starting and 
spreading, the difficulty of control, and the resulting impacts based on an assessment 
of ignition risk, the fire environment (e.g., fuels, weather, and topography) and values at 
risk (NRCan 2009j). Project activities are scheduled to commence during winter 
months (see Table 2.4). 

• The following meteorological data were obtained from an Environment Canada 
meteorological station in Grande Cache, Alberta between 1981 and 2010 (Environment 
Canada 2013). The data were taken approximately 57 km southwest of the proposed 
meter station. 
− Average total annual rainfall for Grande Cache is 347.1 mm. The average monthly 

rainfall is 28.9 mm and the average monthly rainfall from June to August is 
74.9 mm. In June of 1972, Grande Cache recorded its highest daily rainfall of 
88.9 mm, which is above the monthly average of 58.6 mm for June. 

− Average total annual snowfall for Grande Cache is 178.0 cm. The average monthly 
snowfall is 14.8 cm and the average monthly snowfall from November to February 
is 24.0 cm. In May of 1977, Grande Cache recorded its highest daily snowfall of 
61.2 cm, well above the 9.1 cm average for the month of May. 

− Average daily temperature for Grande Cache is 2.7°C with the warmest month in 
July, averaging 13.2°C, and the coolest month in December, averaging -7.5°C. In 
September of 1988 Grande Cache experienced its warmest day of 32.0°C and in 
November of 1985 experienced its coolest day at -43.0°C. 

Soil and Soil Productivity 
Study Area • Based on a close correlation and relationship between the effects of the Project to both 

the physical environment and soils (i.e., construction activities), the spatial boundary of 
the Physical and Meteorological Environment LSA was used to define the spatial 
boundary of the Soils LSA, which is defined as a 1 km wide band centred on the 
proposed pipeline route centre line (i.e., 500 m on both sides of the centre line) and 
500 m around the perimeter of the meter station to incorporate effects that may extend 
off the Footprint (Figure 6.1). Potential effects are not anticipated to extend beyond the 
Soils LSA and, therefore, a Soils RSA has not been established. 

General • The Project is located within the Western Alberta Upland Ecoregion of the Boreal 
Plains Ecozone. Historical and current land use in the ecoregion include forestry, 
agriculture, oil and gas development, hydroelectric power generation, fisheries and 
mining (Environment Canada 2010). 

Pipeline • Glaciolacustrine deposits comprise most of the soils encountered by the northern 
portion of the proposed route (Townships 67 and 68 W6M). The southern portion of the 
route (Townships 65 and 66 W6M) is underlain primarily by sedimentary bedrock 
(Twardy and Corns 1980).  

• The pipeline route encounters the Donnelly soil group in the most northern portion of 
the proposed route (Township 68 W6M), the Copton soil groups (Townships 67 and 
66 W6M) and the Torrens and Smoky soil group (Township 65 W6M) (Twardy and 
Corns 1980).  

• The Donnelly soil group consists mainly of imperfectly-drained Gleyed Solonetzic Gray 
Luvisols developed on fine to very fine textured, slightly stony, stratified, lacustrotill 
deposits (Twardy and Corns 1980). Copton soils are a collection of Brunisolic and 
Luvisolic soils developed on medium to coarse textured sandstones. Soils of the 
Torrens group are Gray Luvisols developed on moderately fine to fine textured shale 
and siltstone deposits (Twardy and Corns 1980). 

• A search of the Federal Contaminated Sites Inventory did not return any results for 
known contaminated sites within the Project LSA (Treasury Board of Canada 
Secretariat 2014). The Environmental Site Assessment Repository of Alberta identified 
one contaminated site that is currently being monitored, located at 10-21-65-7 W6M, 
approximately 300 m south of KP 32 (AESRD 2014b).

TABLE 5.1  Cont’d 

Environmental and 
Socio-Economic 

Elements Summary of Considerations 
Pipeline (cont’d) • The pipeline route will parallel existing disturbance for approximately 78% of its length. 

Potential contaminants of concern may be present from previous pipeline construction 
activities or may occur during construction and maintenance activities. These may 
include compounds routinely used in pipeline construction, such as fusion bond epoxy, 
liquid epoxy pipe coating, paint and hydrocarbons. 

Meter Station • The dominant soil group encountered at the meter station is the Edson soil group. The 
Edson soil group mainly consists of moderately well-drained Gray Luvisols and, to a 
lesser extent, Brunisolic Gray Luvisols. Edson soils are characterized by strongly 
developed Luvisol features (L-H, Ae, Bt horizon sequence) and commonly have silt 
loam to loam surface horizons and clay to clay loam subsurface horizons. Internal soil 
drainage is considered to be good but perched water tables may exist for short periods 
during the year (Twardy and Corns 1980). 

• Parent material for the Edson soils are morainal deposits of weakly to moderately 
calcareous Continental till. The till is generally dark grayish brown to olive brown, is 
moderately fine to fine-textured, firm in consistency and slightly to moderately stony. 
The thickness of till in the meter station Footprint ranges from several centimetres (in 
the uplands) to many metres (in the low lying areas) (Twardy and Corns 1980).  

• A search of the Federal Contaminated Sites Inventory and the Environmental Site 
Assessment Repository of Alberta did not return any results for known contaminated 
sites within the meter station (Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat 2014, 
AESRD 2014b). 

Water Quality and Quantity 
Study Area • The Water Quality and Quantity LSA is defined as a 1 km band centred on the 

proposed pipeline route centre line (i.e., 500 m on both sides of the centre line) to 
incorporate effects that may extend beyond the Footprint (e.g., water erosion). An 
Aquatics RSA is being used for both the Water Quality and Quantity element, and the 
Fish and Fish Habitat element, which is defined as a 30 km wide band centred on the 
proposed pipeline route centre line (i.e., 15 km on both sides of the centre line) 
(Figure 6.2).  

Pipeline • The pipeline route is located within the Peace River Basin in northwest Alberta with 
watercourse crossings in the Cutbank and Kakwa River sub-basins.  

• Bald Mountain Creek originates from several small tributaries in west central Alberta 
and flows north easterly for approximately 70 km to its confluence with Big Mountain 
Creek. After joining Big Mountain Creek, Bald Mountain Creek flow continues north for 
approximately 30 km before entering the Wapiti River. The Wapiti River flows into the 
Smoky River, a major tributary to the Peace River.  

• Direct tributaries within this reach include Wilson and Campbell creeks. 
• The pipeline route crosses 11 watercourses. Bald Mountain Creek (WC1 [KP 4.6]), and 

10 unnamed tributaries to Bald Mountain Creek (at KP 8.2 [WC3], KP 8.7 [WC4], 
KP 10.0 [WC5], KP 12.0 [WC6], KP 14.3 [WC7], KP 16.1 [WC8], KP 16.2 [WC9], 
KP 21.9 [WC10], KP 22.9 [WC11] and KP 23.4 [WC12]) (Natural Resources 
Canada 2007-2011). 

• The pipeline route crosses 28 unnamed drainages that are all considered 
nonfish-bearing. 

• Hydrological information in the Bald Mountain Creek watershed is not monitored by the 
Water Survey of Canada or AESRD. The flow regime in the Bald Mountain Creek 
watershed is expected to be similar to nearby watersheds with similar geography. The 
Water Survey of Canada and AESRD have maintained a hydrometric station on the 
Cutbank River near the City of Grand Prairie (Station Number 07GB001) seasonally 
(i.e., between March and October) from 1970 to 2011 (Environment Canada 2014a). 
Although obvious differences in discharge volumes exist between Bald Mountain Creek 
and the Cutbank River, it is expected that their hydrographs would be similar. Archived 
data from this station indicate that the annual high flow event for Cutbank River 
typically occurs in May, while flows gradually decline through the summer and fall 
(Environment Canada 2014a). The lowest flows are expected in late winter and early 
spring before the lowland areas and mountain snowpack begin to melt.

Elements Summary of Considerations 
Pipeline (cont’d) • The proposed pipeline route will loop NGTL’s existing and operational Cutbank Lateral 

Loop (Bald Mountain Section). 
• The Aquatic Assessment (Appendix 3) incorporates results of three field studies. The 

first was a pre-construction open water aquatic habitat assessment conducted in 
June/July 2010 for the Cutbank Lateral Loop (Bald Mountain Section) (Midwest 
Surveys Inc. 2013), where nine watercourses crossed by the proposed pipeline route 
were determined to have low fisheries values and the sites would be dry and/or frozen 
to the bottom during construction of the paralleling Cutbank Lateral Loop (Bald 
Mountain Section) Pipeline Project (Midwest Surveys Inc. 2013). The second was a 
February 2014 winter aquatic habitat investigations conducted for this Project. Only 
Bald Mountain Creek (WC1) and the unnamed tributary to Bald Mountain Creek (WC9) 
were investigated since the June/July 2010 open water aquatic assessments 
determined that the remaining nine watercourses would be dry or frozen to the bottom. 
The third was a May 2014 open water aquatic habitat assessment. The assessment 
involved collecting updated site photographs and verifying site data previously 
collected during the 2010 Cutbank Lateral Loop (Bald Mountain Section) assessment, 
as well as completing full assessments at all crossing locations on the new portion of 
the line where existing data was not available (TERA Environmental 
Consultants 2010a, Appendix 3). 

• The February 2014 winter aquatic habitat investigation and the May 2014 open water 
aquatic habitat assessment for this Project were both conducted with the assistance of 
members from the Aseniwuche Winewak Nation of Canada, Horse Lake First Nation, 
Sturgeon Lake Cree Nation, Nose Creek Settlement, Métis Nation Association Region 
6, Kelly Lake Cree Nation and Kelly Lake Métis Settlement Society. Aboriginal 
perspectives related to aquatics shared during biophysical field studies can be found in 
Table 2-2 of the TK Report (Appendix 8).  

• There are 21 wells within approximately 1.0 km of the proposed pipeline route center 
line, including 12 industrial wells, 6 for investigations, 1 domestic well and 2 listed as 
unknown/other (AESRD 2014c). The proposed pipeline route is not located in an 
agricultural area; therefore, lands along the route are not rated for surface and 
groundwater quality risk for contaminants or aquifer vulnerability (Alberta Agriculture 
and Rural Development 2011a, b, c). The domestic water well is located approximately 
900 m from the proposed centreline.  

• There are no documented springs located along the proposed route (Alberta Energy 
Regulator/Alberta Geological Survey 2009). Aboriginal participants, however, reported 
the existence of natural springs on both sides of the Cutbank Lateral Loop (Bald 
Mountain Section) pipeline located 13 m west of KP 14.3 and noted that there seems to 
be a more substantial amount of groundwater at this site since the existing pipeline was 
installed. TERA was unable to confirm the presence of springs at this location, since 
TERA was advised of these springs subsequent to the assessment, however the 
location has been documented (see Table 2-2 of Appendix 8). 

• The Project is located within a provincially identified Environmentally Significant Area 
associated with Bald Mountain Creek from KP 3.9 to KP 4.7 (Alberta Tourism, Parks 
and Recreation [ATPR] 2014a,b). This Environmentally Significant Area has been 
identified as having particular importance for ecological integrity and water quality and 
quantity (ATPR 2014b). Environmentally Significant Areas are an information tool 
intended to complement other information sources to inform land-use planning and 
policy and, as such, do not represent natural resource policy or areas requiring specific 
management objectives and do not require legal protection (Fiera Biological Consulting 
Ltd. [Fiera] 2014).

Elements Summary of Considerations 
Meter Station • The proposed meter station is located within the Peace River Basin in northwest 

Alberta.  
• There are seven industrial water wells located within 1.0 km of the meter station 

boundary (AESRD 2014c). 
• There are no documented springs in the vicinity of the proposed meter station (Alberta 

Energy Regulator/Alberta Geological Survey 2009).  
• There are no known watercourses or drainages within 30 m of the proposed meter 

station location; therefore, detailed information is not warranted as per Table A-2 of the 
Filing Manual (NEB 2014a).  

Air Emissions 
Study Area • The Air Emissions RSA (Figure 6.3) is defined as a 5 km wide band centred on the 

proposed pipeline route centre line (i.e., 2.5 km on both sides of the centre line) and a 
5 km radius centred in the middle of the meter station components (i.e., meter station, 
valve site, pipeline tie-in and access road).  

• No Air Emissions LSA was established for the Project.  
General • In the Air Emissions RSA, activities contributing to Criteria Air Contaminants (CACs), 

including sulfur oxides (SOx), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), volatile organic compounds 
(VOCs), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matters less than 2.5 micrometers in 
diameters (PM2.5) are primarily due to oil and gas activities (e.g., crude oil and natural 
gas production) (AENV 2008).  

• Currently, one of the largest contributors of CACs is crude oil and natural gas 
production and processing activities. The contribution of any CAC emissions from 
natural gas transportation by pipelines to total provincial-wide levels is usually less than 
0.01% of production and processing activities (Environment Canada 2014b). 

• During construction of the Project, the primary sources of CACs will include CO, VOCs, 
NOx and PM2.5 from fuel combustion and dust related to the use of transportation 
vehicles and heavy equipment. A temporary increase in airborne emissions is 
anticipated during Project construction from the burning of slash. 

• There will be increased air emissions during operation and maintenance due to 
activities such as vehicle and equipment transportation use, aerial overflights and 
heaters in buildings.  

• The nearest potential human receptor to the Project is a trapper’s cabin located in 
SE 14-68-7 W6M, approximately 550 m west from KP 2.7. 

• The Project does not include the addition or modification of any facilities that are known 
to emit substantial amounts of air emissions, (e.g., flares or incinerators) and will not 
result in a substantial increase in airborne emissions during operation or maintenance 
and there are no outstanding concerns regarding air emissions, and therefore, detailed 
air quality information is not warranted as per Table A-1 of the NEB Filing Manual 
(NEB 2014a). 

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions 
Spatial Boundary • The spatial boundary used in the effects assessment of the GHG emissions considered 

an International area since potential effects associated with their release resulting from 
Project-related activities are global in scope. 

General • The Project does not include any permanent components or activities that are known to 
be a major source of major GHG emissions during operation (e.g., compressor station, 
flaring or gas plant). 

• The primary sources of GHG emissions during construction activities will be from fuel 
combustion while transporting crews to and from the work site and along the proposed 
right-of-way, as well as from the operation of heavy equipment. Any necessary burning 
of slash during construction will also contribute to GHG emissions.

TABLE 5.1  Cont’d 

Environmental and

Elements Summary of Considerations 
General (cont’d) • During operation of the Project, the pipeline is considered a linear source of GHG 

emission. GHG emissions during maintenance activities include aerial overflights, 
vehicle use and planned blowdown events. The meter station will require a heater in 
the instrument building and meter building that are both driven by natural gas and 
expected to be used during maintenance activities in the winter months.  

• Project-specific provincial permits and reporting are not required for the Project as per 
the Alberta Climate Change and Emissions Management Act Specified Gas Reporting 
Regulation (Alberta Regulation 215/2004) and the AESRD Specified Gas Reporting 
Standard which have reporting thresholds well above anticipated Project emissions. 
The Project will be included in NGTL’s existing provincial and federal GHG reporting 
programs. 

• The nearest potential human receptor to the Project is a trapper’s cabin located in 
SE 14-68-7 W6M, approximately 550 m west from KP 2.7. 

• Approximately 7,510 m3 of merchantable timber is expected to be cleared from the 
Project Footprint.  

• Since the proposed Project is not anticipated to generate volumes of GHG emissions 
above applicable federal or provincial reporting criteria during operation or 
maintenance and there are no outstanding concerns regarding Project-related GHG 
emissions, detailed information is not warranted as per Table A-1 of the NEB Filing 
Manual (NEB 2014a). 

Acoustic Environment 
Spatial Boundary • The spatial boundary of the Acoustic Environment LSA for the Project has been 

defined as a 2 km wide band centred on the proposed pipeline route centre line 
(i.e., 1 km on both sides of the centre line) and a 1 km radius centered on the meter 
station components (i.e., meter station, valve site, pipeline tie-in and access road) 
(Figure 6.4). No Acoustic Environment RSA was established for the Project.  

General • Ambient noise in the Project area is primarily caused by anthropogenic sources, 
identified in the Infrastructure and Services element of this table. 

• No local bylaws relating to noise have been identified along the proposed pipeline route 
or at the meter station site. Project activities will occur well outside of the boundaries of 
the Grande Prairie and Grande Cache, where the Grande Prairie Noise, Nuisance, and 
Public Disturbances By-law No. C-1103 or the Grande Cache Noise By-law No. 462 
applies (City of Grande Prairie 2013 and Town of Grande Cache 2014). The MD of 
Greenview currently has no by-laws relating to noise (MD of Greenview 2013a). NGTL 
will ensure the Project will be in compliance with any relevant requirements of the 
Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board Directive 38 Noise Control Guidelines 
(currently regulated by the Alberta Energy Regulator [AER]), which is often used in 
connection with energy-related projects in Alberta and neighbouring provinces. 

• The nearest potential human receptor to the Project is a trapper’s cabin located in 
SE 14-68-7 W6M, approximately 550 m west from KP 2.7. 

• A temporary increase in noise levels is anticipated during construction of the Project. 
The Project is not anticipated to result in an increase in noise emissions during 
operations aside from occasional site-specific maintenance and there are no 
outstanding concerns associated with an increase in noise levels, therefore, detailed 
information related to noise is not warranted as per Table A-2 of the NEB Filing Manual 
(NEB 2014a). 

• Noise arising from construction activities associated with the Project and the potential 
effects on wildlife are discussed under the Wildlife and Wildlife Habitat element of this 
table.

Elements Summary of Considerations 
Fish and Fish Habitat 
Spatial Boundary • The Fish and Fish Habitat LSA is defined as 200 m upstream and a minimum of 300 m 

downstream of the proposed pipeline centre line at all watercourses and drainages 
crossed by the route. A downstream limit of 400 m, based on the ZOI, was used at 
WC1 and 300 m at all remaining watercourse crossings (i.e., WC3 to WC12). The 
Aquatics RSA is being used for both the Water Quality and Quantity element, and the 
Fish and Fish Habitat element, and is defined as a 30 km wide band centred on the 
proposed pipeline route centre line (i.e., 5 km on both sides of the centre line) 
(Figure 6.5).  

Pipeline • The pipeline route is located within the Peace River Basin in northwest Alberta with 
watercourse crossings in the Cutbank and Kakwa River sub-basins.  

• Bald Mountain Creek originates from several small tributaries in west central Alberta 
and flows northeasterly for approximately 70 km to its confluence with Big Mountain 
Creek. After joining Big Mountain Creek, Bald Mountain Creek flow continues north for 
approximately 30 km before entering the Wapiti River. The Wapiti River flows into the 
Smoky River, a major tributary to the Peace River.  

• Direct tributaries within this reach include Wilson and Campbell creeks. 
• The proposed pipeline route will loop NGTL’s existing and operational Cutbank Lateral 

Loop (Bald Mountain Section). 
• The pipeline route crosses 11 watercourses. Bald Mountain Creek (WC1 [KP 4.67]), 

and 10 unnamed tributaries to Bald Mountain Creek (at KP 8.2 [WC3], KP 8.7 [WC4], 
KP 10.0 [WC5], KP 12.0 [WC6], KP 14.3 [WC7], KP 16.1 [WC8], KP 16.2 [WC9], 
KP 21.9 [WC10], KP 22.9 [WC11] and KP 23.4 [WC12]) (Natural Resources 
Canada 2007-2011). 

• All 11 of the watercourses crossed by the proposed route have a restricted activity 
period (RAP) of August 1 to July 15 to protect sensitive life history stages of fish from 
being negatively affected by instream activities (Alberta Sustainable Resource 
Development [ASRD] 2006). 

• The pipeline route crosses 28 unnamed drainages that are all considered 
nonfish-bearing. 

• The Aquatic Assessment (Appendix 3) incorporates results of three field studies. The 
first was a pre-construction open water aquatic habitat assessment conducted in 
June/July 2010 for the Cutbank Lateral Loop (Bald Mountain Section) (Midwest 
Surveys Inc. 2013), where nine watercourses crossed by the proposed pipeline route 
were determined to have low fisheries values and the sites would be dry and/or frozen 
to the bottom during construction of the paralleling Cutbank Lateral Loop (Bald 
Mountain Section) Pipeline Project (Midwest Surveys Inc. 2013). The second was a 
February 2014 winter aquatic habitat investigations conducted for this Project. Only 
Bald Mountain Creek (WC1) and the unnamed tributary to Bald Mountain Creek (WC9) 
were investigated since the June/July 2010 open water aquatic assessments 
determined that the remaining nine watercourses would be dry or frozen to the bottom. 
The third was a May 2014 open water aquatic habitat assessment. The assessment 
involved collecting updated site photographs and verifying site data previously 
collected during the 2010 Cutbank Lateral Loop (Bald Mountain Section) assessment, 
as well as completing full assessments at all crossing locations on the new portion of

Consultants 2010a, Appendix 3). 

• The February 2014 winter aquatic habitat investigation and the May 2014 open water 
aquatic habitat assessment were both conducted with the assistance of members from 
the Aseniwuche Winewak Nation of Canada, Horse Lake First Nation, Sturgeon Lake 
Cree Nation, Nose Creek Settlement, Métis Nation Association Region 6, Kelly Lake 
Cree Nation and Kelly Lake Métis Settlement Society. Aboriginal perspectives related 
to aquatics shared during biophysical field studies by Aboriginal participants can be 
found in Table 2-2 of the TK Report for the Project (Appendix 8).

Elements Summary of Considerations 
Pipeline (cont’d) • The fish communities in the Peace River Basin near the pipeline route are mixed 

assemblages containing both coldwater (e.g., salmonids) and coolwater (e.g., percids 
and esocids) species (Nelson and Paetz 1992).  

• Fish species of management concern for this sub-watershed include bull trout, Arctic 
grayling, largescale sucker, northern redbelly dace and spoonhead sculpin. A full list of 
species that may occur near the proposed pipeline route is provided in the Aquatic 
Assessment (Appendix 3). 

• Provincially, bull trout, Arctic grayling, largescale sucker and northern redbelly dace are 
listed under the general status as Sensitive by ASRD (2010). In addition, Alberta’s 
Endangered Species Conservation Committee (ESCC) has further listed bull trout and 
Arctic grayling with a detailed status of Species of Special Concern (Arctic grayling) 
and Threatened (bull trout) (AESRD 2014d). Spoonhead sculpin are also provincially 
listed as May be at Risk and pearl dace and finescale dace are listed as Undetermined. 
Although Alberta considers northern pike as Secure (ASRD 2011), the species has 
experienced severe population declines across most of their range and the province 
has implemented management and recovery plans (Berry 1999). Angler overharvest 
and habitat degradation are commonly cited in these management plans as key factors 
that have led to the decline of these species. 

• These species occur in the Bald Mountain Creek watershed, the nearby Cutbank River 
and Kakwa sub-basins, however, are not expected to occur in the ZOI of the proposed 
watercourse crossings. 

• The Project is located within a provincially identified Environmentally Significant Area 
associated with Bald Mountain Creek from KP 3.9 to KP 4.7 (ATPR 2014a,b). This 
Environmentally Significant Area has been identified as having particular importance 
for ecological integrity and water quality and quantity (ATPR 2014b). Environmentally 
Significant Areas are an information tool intended to complement other information 
sources to inform land-use planning and policy and, as such, do not represent natural 
resource policy or areas requiring specific management objectives and do not require 
legal protection (Fiera 2014). 

Meter Station • There are no watercourses located within 30 m of the proposed meter station, 
therefore, detailed fish and fish habitat information is not warranted as per Table A-1 of 
the NEB Filing Manual (NEB 2014a). 

Wetlands 
Spatial Boundary • The spatial boundary of the Wetland LSA is defined as a 300 m wide band centred on 

the proposed pipeline route centre line (i.e., 150 m on both sides of the centre line). 
The spatial boundary of the Wetland RSA for the Project is defined as a 30 km wide 
band centred on the proposed pipeline route centre line (i.e., 15 km on both sides of 
the pipeline route) (Figure 6.6).  

• The Project is located within the Continental Mid-Boreal Wetland Region, a component 
of the Boreal Wetland Region. Wetlands present in this region are primarily bogs and 
fens. Marsh wetlands may be found along gently sloping lakeshores. The average peat 
depth within the Continental Mid-boreal is 4 m (Government of Canada 1986). 

Pipeline • The proposed pipeline route crosses the Central Mixedwood, the Upper Foothills and 
the Lower Foothills Natural Subregions of Alberta. The Central Mixedwood Natural 
Subregion of the Boreal Forest Natural Region is dominated by wetlands including 
treed fens and marsh wetlands and many small lakes also occur within this natural 
region. The Upper Foothills and Lower Foothills Natural Subregions are components of 
the Foothills Natural Region. Wetlands present in the Upper Foothills Natural 
Subregion are typically shrubby and treed fens, while wetland types found in the Lower 
Foothills Natural Subregion are predominantly treed fens with some bogs and open 
fens (Natural Regions Committee 2006). 

• Wetlands provide habitat for native plants and wildlife species, including nesting and 
foraging habitat for a variety of bird species, forage and cover for ungulates and 
fur-bearers and breeding habitat for amphibians. Wetlands provide water storage, 
groundwater recharge and natural filtering of sediments.

Elements Summary of Considerations 
Pipeline (cont’d) • Alberta represents approximately 7% of Canada’s land mass. Wetlands in Alberta 

cover approximately 20% of the province, over 90% of which are peatlands in the 
boreal region, while the remaining 5-10% are mineral wetlands (i.e., marshes, swamps 
and shallow open water wetlands) in the parkland and prairie region (National 
Wetlands Working Group 1986, Tarnocai 1984, Vitt et al. 1996). 

• The proposed pipeline route will loop NGTL’s existing and operational Cutbank River 
Lateral Loop (Bald Mountain Section) pipeline. In June 2010, pre-construction wetland 
surveys were conducted along this pipeline and identified three wetlands crossed 
including two treed bogs and an emergent marsh (TERA Environmental 
Consultants 2010b). Due to the isolated nature of some of the wetlands encountered, 
only one of the wetlands delineated during the 2010 surveys along the Cutbank River 
Lateral Loop (Bald Mountain Section), a basin bog (treed bog), correlates with 
delineations made in 2014 (Wetland Reference 1) and was determined to be 
encountered by the proposed pipeline. 

• Further field studies conducted by TERA on June 18 and 19, 2014 incorporated the 
results of a helicopter reconnaissance and a helicopter-supported ground-based 
wetland survey. Additional information regarding the location and classification of 
wetlands crossed by the proposed pipeline route is provided in Appendix 4. 

• There are five wetland ecosystems identified as being crossed, comprising 
approximately 2.8% (0.9 km) of the length of the proposed pipeline route. Wetlands 
crossed include one basin bog (treed bog), one riparian swamp (mixedwood treed 
swamp), one flat swamp (shrubby swamp), one channel marsh (wet meadow) and one 
basin fen (shrubby fen). All five of these wetlands are crossed by the proposed 
construction right-of-way and temporary workspace. 

• The terrain along the pipeline route is undulating forest with existing disturbances such 
as cut blocks, existing pipeline rights-of-way, access roads and lease sites. There are 
some small isolated wet areas best described as moist forest and therefore, 
non-wetland, along the pipeline route. A diversity of other forbs with low cover is 
typical. Sites often have distinct mounds created by fallen trees, interspersed with 
lower areas of standing water, however, some stands are drier and have a more 
continuous herbaceous understory. These areas are not delineated as wetlands due to 
their lack of hydric soils. Regenerating cut blocks along the pipeline route are 
abundant, creating areas of sapling black spruce that have the appearance of stunted 
black spruce often found in treed fens and bogs. These areas lack a peat layer 
(i.e., hydric substrate) and the vegetation community composition differs from wetland 
habitat (e.g., non-hydrophytic forbs and graminoid species present). These areas are 
not delineated as wetlands due to their lack of hydrology, hydrophytic vegetation and 
hydric soils (qualifying parameters used to define a wetland). 

• There is one wetland, a riparian marsh (seasonal emergent marsh) (Wetland 
Reference 2), not crossed by the proposed pipeline route but located within the 
Wetlands LSA approximately 25 m east of KP 4.6 (SW 23-68-7 W6M), which was 
identified as being associated with Bald Mountain Creek. This wetland has been 
modified by beaver activity. Historic beaver dams were also noted at a riparian swamp 
(mixedwood treed swamp) (Wetland Reference 3, approximately KP 16.0). No beaver 
ponds (i.e., shallow open water components) were identified as being crossed by the 
proposed pipeline route.

Elements Summary of Considerations 
Pipeline (cont’d) • The proposed pipeline route is not located within any of the following:  

− Important Bird Areas (Bird Studies Canada and Nature Canada 2014); 
− Migratory Bird Sanctuaries and National Wildlife Areas (Environment 

Canada 2014c); 
− Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserves (Western Hemisphere Shorebird 

Reserve Network 2012); 
− Ramsar Wetlands of International Importance (Bureau of the Convention on 

Wetlands 2014); or 
− World Biosphere Reserves (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 

Organization 2014). 
• Ducks Unlimited Canada (DUC) has identified three levels of priority for wetland 

conservation in Canada. Priority areas are threatened landscapes identified for 
conservation in order to provide a healthier environment for waterfowl. The pipeline 
route is located within DUC Level 1 Priority Area, the Prairie Pothole Region and 
Western Boreal Forest. The Western Boreal Forest supports populations of 11 to 
15 million waterfowl that use the area for breeding, migration, moulting and staging. 
This region serves as one of two primary breeding areas for waterfowl in North America 
(DUC 2014). 

• As noted, the proposed pipeline route crosses one Environmentally Significant Area 
associated with Bald Mountain Creek from KP 3.90 to KP 4.70 (associated with 
Wetland 1) (Fiera 2014). As the designation does not have any special regulatory 
requirements it is not anticipated to affect construction methods or scheduling. 

• TEK was collected with members from Aseniwuche Winewak Nation of Canada, Horse 
Lake First Nation, Grande Cache Métis Local No.1994, Kelly Lake Cree Nation, Kelly 
Lake First Nation, Kelly Lake Métis Settlement Society, Nose Creek Settlement 
Society, and Sturgeon Lake Cree Nation. Aboriginal perspectives related to wetlands 
shared during biophysical field studies can be found in Table 2-3 of the TK Report for 
the Project (Appendix 8). The proposed mitigation measures outlined in the EPP 
(Appendix 1) address these issues. 

Meter Station • The proposed meter station is located within the Upper Foothills Natural Subregion of 
the Foothills Natural Region. Wetlands present in the Upper Foothills Natural 
Subregion are typically shrubby and treed fens (Natural Regions Committee 2006). 

• The location of the site was reviewed for potential wetlands through satellite imagery 
interpretation in which no wetlands were identified within 30 m of the boundary of the 
proposed meter station, including the proposed site, access road and pipeline tie-in. 
Therefore, detailed information is not warranted as per Table A-1 of the NEB Filing 
Manual (NEB 2014a). 

Vegetation 
Spatial Boundary • The spatial boundary of the Vegetation LSA has been defined as a 300 m wide band 

centred on proposed pipeline route centre line (i.e., 150 m on both sides of the centre 
line) and a 300 m buffer around the perimeter of the meter station. The Vegetation LSA 
was established to incorporate the area in which vegetation resources are most likely 
to be affected by the construction and operation of the Project. The spatial boundary for 
the Vegetation RSA has been defined as a 5 km wide band centred on the proposed 
pipeline route centre line (i.e., 2.5 km wide area on both sides of the centre line) and a 
2.5 km buffer around the perimeter of the meter station components (Figure 6.7).

Elements Summary of Considerations 
General • Information collected during the rare plant survey and rare plant monitoring conducted 

for the Cutbank River Lateral Loop (Bald Mountain Section) Pipeline Project in 2010 
and 2013 respectively was considered for the pipeline component of the Project (TERA 
Environmental Consultants 2010c, TERA 2014a). 

• As noted, the Project is located within a provincial Environmentally Significant Area 
associated with Bald Mountain Creek from KP 3.9 to KP 4.7 (ATPR 2014a,b). 

• The Project is located entirely within the MD of Greenview. Weeds of concern in the 
MD of Greenview include all knapweeds, all non-native hawkweed complex species, 
scentless chamomile, common tansy, ox-eye daisy, tall buttercup, yellow toadflax 
(common toadflax) and white cockle (bladder campion) (Nepstad pers. comm.).  

• As noted, the pipeline route is located on Crown-owned, forested land located within 
the Boreal Plains Ecozone (Environment Canada 2010). The pipeline is located in the 
Lower Foothills and Upper Foothills Natural Subregions of the Foothills Natural Region 
and the Central Mixedwood Subregion of the Boreal Natural Region (Natural Regions 
Committee 2006). 

Pipeline • Natural landscapes in the Upper Foothills Subregion are characterized by closed, 
conifer-dominated forests occurring on rolling to steeply sloping terrain. Forests in this 
subregion are often dominated by lodgepole pine with black spruce and white spruce 
as minor components. Deciduous and mixedwood forests occur on southerly and 
westerly slopes, often at lower elevations. The Upper Foothills Subregion has a 
shorter, cooler growing season than the adjacent Lower Foothills Subregion. As a 
result, the communities in this Subregion are generally less diverse (Natural Regions 
Committee 2006).  

• Natural landscapes in the Lower Foothills Natural Subregion are characterized by 
rolling, till-covered plateaus forested by mesic, closed canopy mixed stands of aspen, 
lodgepole pine, white spruce and balsam poplar. Common understory species on 
mesic sites include: green alder; low-bush cranberry; prickly rose; wild sarsaparilla; 
dewberry; fireweed; and bluejoint (Natural Regions Committee 2006). 

• The Central Mixedwood Natural Subregion is the largest Natural Subregion in Alberta 
and is characterized by upland forests and wetlands on level to gently undulating 
plains. Upland forests are a mosaic of aspen, mixedwood and white spruce. Common 
understory species include: low-bush cranberry, prickly rose, green alder, Canada 
buffaloberry, hairy wild rye, bunchberry, wild sarsaparilla, and dewberry. Jack pine 
stands occur on coarser materials. Wetlands are often extensive and are dominated by 
black spruce fens and bogs (Natural Regions Committee 2006). 

• Whitebark pine, designated as Endangered (i.e., a species facing imminent extirpation 
or extinction) by COSEWIC and SARA is identified as potentially occurring in the Upper 
Foothills Natural Subregion (ACIMS 2014a,b). Whitebark and limber pine, designated 
as Endangered under the Alberta Wildlife Act are also identified as potentially occurring 
in the Upper Foothills Natural Subregion (ACIMS 2014a,b). Based on the known range, 
occurrences and habitat requirements of whitebark pine and limber pine 
(Kershaw et al. 2001, Moss 1983), these plant species are not expected to occur along 
the proposed pipeline route. 

• There are no species listed by COSEWIC, the SARA or the Alberta Wildlife Act that are 
known to occur in the Lower Foothills or Central Mixedwood Natural Subregions. 

• A search of the ACIMS database identified ten previous observations of rare vegetation 
within 5 km of the proposed pipeline route. These included seven rare vascular plant 
species (golden saxifrage, lance-leaved grape fern, Macloskey’s violet, northwestern 
grapefern, scalloped moonwort, ascending grape fern and leafy pondweed), one 
liverwort species (snakeskin liverwort) and two lichen species (bloody-heart lichen and 
variable wrinkle lichen) (ACIMS 2014a). There is one known rare ecological community 
(aspen/thimbleberry/wild sarsaparilla) within 10 km of the proposed pipeline route 
(ACIMS 2014a).

Elements Summary of Considerations 
Pipeline (cont’d) • TERA Environmental Consultants (2010c) observed five species (northern moonwort, 

leather grape fern, snakeskin liverwort, Macloskey’s violet and ascending grape fern) 
along the Cutbank River Lateral Loop (Bald Mountain Section) during a rare plant 
survey conducted in 2010. Mitigation for rare species was undertaken at twelve 
locations. Mitigation was deemed successful at eleven locations and unsuccessful at 
one location during the 2013 rare plant monitoring conducted on the Cutbank River 
Lateral Loop (Bald Mountain Section) (TERA Environmental Consultants 2013a). A 
review of Phase 3 Forest Inventory maps and ground surveys indicated that 13% of the 
Productive Forest Lands crossed by the proposed pipeline route range from 
approximately 60 to 70 years in age (Alberta Energy and Natural Resources 
[AENR] 1970-1984). The proposed pipeline route crosses deciduous dominated and 
mixed-wood forests with age classes of late successional forests (Timoney 2001, 
AENR 1970-1984). Further details of late-successional forest are provided in 
Appendix 5. 

• The proposed pipeline route encounters two PNTs related to vegetation including PNT 
10018, which is associated with University of Alberta Research Plots in 8-23-68-7 W6M 
(KP 0.5 to KP 0.9) and PNT 10022, which is associated with Ainsworth Lumber Co. 
Ltd. Superior Tree Candidate Site Selection #8037 in 9-22-67-7 W6M (KP 10.7 to 
KP 11.2) (Alberta Energy 2014a). These land dispositions are explained further in the 
HORU section.  

• An early season vegetation survey was conducted from June 18 to 20, 2014 
(Appendix 5) to identify rare vegetation and rare ecological communities, record the 
location of non-native and invasive species, forest health issues and late successional 
forest and collect and incorporate TEK. In accordance with established rare plant 
survey guidelines, TERA would typically conduct both an early and late-season survey 
(Alberta Native Plant Council 2012) between June 1 and August 31 in order to assess 
the presence of rare vegetation species throughout the growing season. For this 
Project, only one survey was completed from June 18 to 20, 2014. The Project 
parallels the Cutbank River Lateral Loop (Bald Mountain Section) for nearly all of its 
length. In 2010, TERA conducted both early and late season surveys of this route. All 
of the rare species observed in 2010 can be identified in the early season survey. 
Given the high level of confidence regarding potential rare species on the proposed 
pipeline route it was determined that, for the Project, a single early season survey was 
sufficient.  

• No SARA, COSEWIC, Alberta Wildlife Act listed vegetation species or rare ecological 
communities were observed during the vegetation survey for the Project. The following 
five ACIMS-listed rare vegetation species were observed during the vegetation survey: 
alternating dog-lichen (S2), golden saxifrage (S3?), Macloskey’s violet (S2S3), naked 
kidney lichen (S2) and snakeskin liverwort (S2). No ACIMS listed rare ecological 
communities were observed during the vegetation survey. 

• The Project is located entirely in MPB Management Zones designated as an Inactive 
Zone (AESRD 2012b). The Inactive Holding Zone is defined as an area where beetle 
populations have grown to a point where population management through Level 1 
(single-tree treatments) or Level 2 (block or patch harvesting of infestations) treatments 
will no longer be effective (ASRD 2007). Management in the Inactive Holding Zone 
focuses on the protection of other forest management objectives such as fish and 
wildlife habitat, timber, watershed protection and wildfire fuel management. 

• MPB symptoms were observed during the vegetation survey conducted for the Project 
and are visible on satellite imagery. Locations of the MPB infestations are provided in 
Appendix 5.

Elements Summary of Considerations 
Pipeline (cont’d) • No Prohibited Noxious or Noxious weeds were observed during the 2014 vegetation 

survey along the proposed pipeline route. No weed species of concern to the MD of 
Greenview were observed during the 2014 vegetation survey. Non-native, introduced 
and invasive species observed during the 2014 vegetation survey included common 
dandelion, cicer milk vetch, hemp-nettle, red clover, white clover, and yellow 
sweet-clover. Weedy species were primarily observed on the existing right-of-way. The 
abundance of weedy species along the construction right-of-way in 2014 was low to 
medium. 

• TEK was collected with members from Horse Lake First Nation, Métis Nation of Alberta 
Association Region 6, Kelly Lake Cree Nation, Kelly Lake Métis Settlement Society and 
Aseniwuche Winewak Nation of Canada during the vegetation assessment conducted 
for the Project in June 2014. Vegetation is harvested by Aboriginal community 
members for food, medicinal, spiritual, ceremonial and utilitarian purposes. Full results 
of the vegetation TEK collected related to vegetation resources as well as proposed 
mitigation measures and/or responses to those issues are compiled in Table 2-4 of 
Appendix 8. 

Meter Station • The proposed meter station is situated within the Western Alberta Upland Ecoregion of 
the Boreal Plains Ecozone. It is characterized by mixed forests of lodgepole pine, white 
spruce, balsam poplar, trembling aspen and paper birch. Conifers are more prevalent 
at higher elevations in the foothills, while the lower plains section is dominated by 
aspen (Ecological Stratification Working Group 1996).  

• As previously noted, the proposed meter station is located in the Upper Foothills 
Natural Subregion of the Foothills Natural Region.  

• Records of rare vegetation observations within 5 km of the meter station were acquired 
from the ACIMS (2014a) database. One provincially-listed lichen (ACIMS) record was 
found variable wrinkled lichen (Tuckermannopsis orbata) within the boundaries of the 
Vegetation LSA defined for the meter station.  

• There is no late-successional forest identified at the meter station.  
• The proposed meter station and associated components (i.e., access road, valve site 

and pipeline tie-in) are located on native vegetation based upon a review of satellite 
imagery.  

• After reviewing satellite imagery and field data from the Musreau Cutbank Expansion 
Project (TERA 2014a), a vegetation survey was not conducted at the Musreau North 
Receipt Meter Station because this location was deemed to have low potential to 
support rare vegetation and/or rare ecological communities. 

Wildlife and Wildlife Habitat 
Spatial Boundary • The Wildlife LSA is defined as an approximately 2 km wide band centred on the 

proposed pipeline route centre line (i.e., 1 km on both sides of the centre line) and a 
1 km radius centred in the middle of the meter station. The Wildlife LSA incorporates 
the Footprint and adjacent areas of indirect disturbance. The Wildlife RSA is defined as 
an approximate 30 km wide band centred on the proposed pipeline route centre line 
(i.e., 15 km on both sides of the centre line) and a 15 km radius centred in the middle of 
the meter station and associated access road (Figure 6.4). 

Pipeline • The proposed pipeline route is not located within any provincially identified wildlife 
areas (AESRD 2014e). 

• The pipeline route does not encounter or is in the vicinity of any of the following: 
− Parks and Protected Areas (ATPR 2013); 
− Migratory Bird Sanctuaries (Environment Canada 2014c);  
− National Wildlife Areas (Environment Canada 2014c);  
− Important Bird Areas (Bird Studies Canada and Nature Canada 2014);  
− Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserves (Western Hemisphere Shorebird 

Reserve Network 2012);  
− Ramsar Wetlands (Bureau of the Convention on Wetlands 2014); and 
− World Biosphere Reserves (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 

Organization 2014).

Elements Summary of Considerations 
Pipeline (cont’d) • The Project is located within a provincial Environmentally Significant Area associated 

with Bald Mountain Creek from KP 3.9 to KP 4.7 (ATPR 2014a,b). 
• A search of the AESRD FWMIS records (AESRD 2014f) identified records of three 

species listed on Schedule 1 of SARA (Environment Canada 2014d) and/or by 
COSEWIC (2014), and two additional provincially-listed species (ASRD 2011) within 
1 km of the proposed pipeline route, including:  
− American badger (Taxidea taxus taxus) (Special Concern by COSEWIC); 
− Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) (Sensitive in Alberta); 
− fisher (Martes pennant) (Sensitive in Alberta); 
− grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) (Special Concern by COSEWIC); and 
− Canada warbler (Cardellina canadensis) (Threatened on Schedule 1 of SARA and 

by COSEWIC). 
• During the February 2014 winter tracking surveys, a total of 13 mammal species and 

10 bird species or their sign were observed. Three provincial species of special 
conservation status (all Sensitive) (ASRD 2011) or their sign were observed, including: 
− Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis); 
− barred owl (Strix varia); and 
− northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) (see Appendix 6). 

• During the June 2014 wildlife field work, a total of 9 mammal species, 58 bird species 
and 2 amphibian species or their sign were observed. Nine species of special 
conservation status or their sign were observed, including:  
− grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) (At Risk in Alberta, Threatened under the 

Alberta Wildlife Act, and Special Concern by COSEWIC); 
− American kestrel (Falco sparverius) (Sensitive in Alberta); 
− Cape May warbler (Setophaga tigrina) (Sensitive in Alberta); 
− common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas) (Sensitive in Alberta); 
− least flycatcher (Empidonax minimus) (Sensitive in Alberta); 
− peregrine falcon (Falco peregrines) (At Risk in Alberta, Threatened under the 

Alberta Wildlife Act, and Special Concern on Schedule 1 of SARA and by 
COSEWIC); 

− sora (Porzana carolina) (Sensitive in Alberta); 
− western wood-pewee (Contopus sordidulus) (Sensitive in Alberta); and 
− western toad (Bufo boreas) (Sensitive in Alberta and Special Concern on Schedule 

1 of SARA and by COSEWIC) (AESRD 2014d, ASRD 2011, COSEWIC 2014, 
Environment Canada 2014d) (see Appendix 6). 

• Wildlife TEK was collected during the vegetation, aquatics, wetland and wildlife surveys 
for the Project with members from Aseniwuche Winewak Nation of Canada, Horse 
Lake First Nation, Sturgeon Lake Cree Nation, Grand Cache Métis Local #1994, Nose 
Creek Settlement Society, Kelly Lake First Nation, Kelly Lake Cree Nation, Kelly Lake 
Métis Settlement Society, and Métis Nation of Alberta Association Region 6. Evidence 
of wildlife occurring in the region included black bear, grizzly bear, moose and wolf. Full 
results of the wildlife TEK collected related to wildlife resources are compiled in 
Table 2-5 of Appendix 8.

Elements Summary of Considerations 
Meter Station  • The proposed meter station is located within a provincially identified Secondary Grizzly 

Bear Zone (AESRD 2014e). The proposed meter station is not located within any other 
provincially identified wildlife areas (AESRD 2014e). 

• The proposed meter station is not located within or in the vicinity of any of the following: 
− Environmentally Significant Areas (ATPR 2014a,b);  
− Parks and Protected Areas (ATPR 2013); 
− Migratory Bird Sanctuaries (Environment Canada 2014c);  
− National Wildlife Areas (Environment Canada 2014c);  
− Important Bird Areas (Bird Studies Canada and Nature Canada 2012);  
− Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserves (Western Hemisphere Shorebird 

Reserve Network 2012);  
− Ramsar Wetlands (Bureau of the Convention on Wetlands 2014); and 
− World Biosphere Reserves (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 

Organization 2013). 
• A search of the AESRD FWMIS records (AESRD 2014f) identified records of two 

species listed on Schedule 1 of SARA (Environment Canada 2014d) and/or by 
COSEWIC (2014) within 1 km of the proposed meter station, including:  
− grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horriblis) (Special Concern by COSEWIC); and 
− western toad (Bufo boreas) (Special Concern on Schedule 1 of SARA and by 

COSEWIC). 
• During the June 2014 wildlife field work, 1 mammal species and 7 bird species or their 

sign were observed in the vicinity of the meter station: moose; chipping sparrow; 
Swainson’s thrush; dark-eyed junco; orange-crowned warbler; ruby-crowned kinglet; 
American robin and tree swallow. No species of special conservation status or their 
sign were observed. 

Species at Risk or Species of Special Status and Related Habitat 
Aquatics • Bull trout are listed by COSEWIC as Special Concern (COSEWIC 2014). However, 

they are not known to occur within the ZOI of the proposed watercourse crossings. 
Spoonhead sculpin are listed as Not at Risk by COSEWIC (COSEWIC 2014), however, 
they are listed on the COSEWIC candidate list as low-priority for a detailed status 
assessment (COSEWIC 2014) and are listed provincially as May be at Risk 
(ASRD 2011). Arctic grayling are high-priority candidates for a detailed status 
assessment, while slimy sculpin are mid-priority candidates for a detailed assessment 
by COSEWIC (2014).  

• Provincially, bull trout and Arctic grayling are listed under the general status as 
Sensitive by ASRD (2010). In addition, Alberta’s ESCC has further listed these two 
species with a detailed status of Species of Special Concern (Arctic grayling) and 
Threatened (bull trout) (AESRD 2014d). 

• These species (i.e., Bull trout, spoonhead sculpin, Arctic grayling) are not expected to 
occur in any of the watercourses crossed by the proposed pipeline, but are found in or 
near the watershed. Additional information concerning fish and fish habitat at 
watercourses crossed by the proposed route is provided in the Aquatic Assessment 
(Appendix 3). 

Vegetation • No SARA, COSEWIC or Alberta Wildlife Act listed vegetation species or rare ecological 
communities were observed along the proposed pipeline route.  

Wildlife - Pipeline • The spatial boundaries defined for Wildlife and Wildlife Habitat (i.e., Wildlife LSA and 
RSA, Grizzly Bear RSA) are used for the assessment of wildlife Species at Risk 
(Figure 6.4).

Elements Summary of Considerations 
Wildlife – Pipeline 
(cont’d) 

• A list of wildlife species with special conservation status that have the potential to occur 
along the proposed route is included in Appendix 6. The list is based on wildlife species 
identified as having the potential to occur in the Central Mixedwood Subregion of the 
Boreal Natural Region and Upper Foothills Subregion and Lower Foothills Subregion of 
the Foothills Natural Region (Natural Regions Committee 2006), and refined based on 
species range, species habitat requirements and professional knowledge. The 
COSEWIC and SARA-listed Schedule 1, wildlife species with potential to occur in the 
vicinity of the Project include the following:  
− grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) (Special Concern by COSEWIC); 
− little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus) (Endangered by COSEWIC); 
− northern myotis (Myotis septentrionalis) (Endangered by COSEWIC); 
− wolverine (Gulo gulo) (Special Concern by COSEWIC); 
− bank swallow (Riparia riparia) (Threatened by COSEWIC);  
− barn swallow (Hirundo rustic) (Threatened by COSEWIC);  
− Canada warbler (Cardellina canadensis) (Threatened on Schedule 1 of SARA and 

by COSEWIC); 
− common nighthawk (Chordeiles minor) (Threatened on Schedule 1 of SARA and by 

COSEWIC); 
− horned grebe (Podiceps auritus) (Special Concern by COSEWIC); 
− olive-sided flycatcher (Contopus cooper) (Threatened on Schedule 1 of SARA and 

by COSEWIC); 
− rusty blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) (Special Concern on Schedule 1 of SARA and 

by COSEWIC); 
− short-eared owl (Asio flammeus) (Special Concern by COSEWIC);  
− yellow rail (Coturnicops noveboracensis) (Special concern on Schedule 1 of SARA 

and by COSEWIC); and 
− western toad (Anaxyrus boreas) (Special Concern on Schedule 1 of SARA and by 

COSEWIC). 
• A search of the AESRD FWMIS records (AESRD 2014f) identified records of three 

species listed on Schedule 1 of SARA (Environment Canada 2014d) and/or by 
COSEWIC (2014) within 1 km of the proposed pipeline route, including:  
− American badger (Special Concern by COSEWIC); 
− grizzly bear (Special Concern by COSEWIC); and 
− Canada warbler (Threatened on Schedule 1 of SARA and by COSEWIC). 

• American badgers have been identified within 1 km of the Project (AESRD 2014f), 
however, these occurrences are considered extralimital given that the Project is outside 
of the typical range for this species (COSEWIC 2012, Scobie 2002). 

• An adult western toad was observed on the proposed Project right-of-way in mature 
deciduous forest at KP 5.8 during the field work completed in June 2010 for the 
Cutbank River Lateral Loop, but no breeding pond was observed (TERA Environmental 
Consultants 2010d). 

• No species with federal special conservation status were observed during the winter 
tracking surveys conducted in February 2014. Three species with federal special 
conservation status or their sign were observed during the June 2014 wildlife surveys, 
including: 
− grizzly bear (Special Concern by COSEWIC); 
− peregrine falcon (Special Concern on Schedule 1 of SARA and by COSEWIC); and 
− western toad (Special Concern on Schedule 1 of SARA and by COSEWIC) 

(Appendix 6).

Elements Summary of Considerations 
Wildlife – Pipeline 
(cont’d) 

• Western toads were observed during the June 2014 wildlife field work at four locations 
as described below.  
− An adult western toad was heard in a marsh located approximately 25 m east of the 

proposed pipeline right-of-way at KP 4.6 (which is 3 m east of the proposed Bald 
Mountain Creek contingency crossing right-of-way). 

− Western toad adults were observed (visual and auditory) in a shrubby fen on the 
proposed pipeline right-of-way at KP 27.1. 

− Western toad tadpoles were observed at two locations in low-lying depressions 
adjacent to the proposed pipeline right-of-way: approximately 32 m west of the 
proposed pipeline right-of-way at KP 9.7; and within proposed temporary 
workspace for the Project at KP 27.4. 

• The observation of the peregrine falcon is considered extralimital given that the Project 
is outside of the typical range for this species (AESRD 2014e, COSEWIC 2007a). 
There are no potential breeding areas for peregrine falcon (i.e., cliffs) along the 
proposed pipeline route. 

Wildlife – Meter 
Station 

• A list of wildlife species with special conservation status that have the potential to occur 
at the proposed meter station is included in Appendix 6. The list is based on wildlife 
species identified as having the potential to occur in the Lower Foothills Subregion of 
the Foothills Natural Region (Natural Regions Committee 2006), and refined based on 
species range, species habitat requirements and professional knowledge. The 
COSEWIC and SARA-listed Schedule 1, wildlife species with potential to occur in the 
vicinity of the Project include the following:  
− grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) (Special Concern by COSEWIC); 
− little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus) (Endangered by COSEWIC); 
− northern myotis (Myotis septentrionalis) (Endangered by COSEWIC); 
− wolverine (Gulo gulo) (Special Concern by COSEWIC); 
− olive-sided flycatcher (Contopus cooper) (Threatened on Schedule 1 of SARA and 

by COSEWIC); and 
− western toad (Anaxyrus boreas) (Special Concern on Schedule 1 of SARA and by 

COSEWIC). 
• A search of the AESRD FWMIS records (AESRD 2014f) identified records of two 

species listed on Schedule 1 of SARA (Environment Canada 2014d) and/or by 
COSEWIC (2014) within 1 km of the proposed meter station, including:  
− grizzly bear (Special Concern by COSEWIC); and 
− western toad (Special Concern on Schedule 1 of SARA and by COSEWIC). 

• No species with federal special conservation status were observed during the 
June 2014 wildlife surveys. 

HORU  
Spatial Boundary • The HORU LSA is defined as an approximate 2 km wide band centred on the proposed 

pipeline route centre line (i.e., 1 km on both sides of the centre line) and 1.5 km band 
extending from the boundary of the meter station. The HORU LSA incorporates the 
Footprint and adjacent areas of indirect disturbance and is based on the area that 
could be directly affected by localized Project-specific effects. The HORU RSA is 
defined as an approximate 30 km band centred on the proposed pipeline route centre 
line (i.e., 15 km on both sides of the centre line) (Figure 6.8). 

General • The Project is located entirely on Crown land in the Green Area of Alberta and is 
situated in the MD of Greenview. 

• The MD of Greenview has limited control over many activities (e.g., forestry, oil and 
gas) permitted on Crown lands. However, the MD of Greenview Municipal 
Development Plan (MDP) (By-law No. 03-397) includes land use planning objectives 
that acknowledge the oil and gas industry as an important component of the region’s 
economy (MD of Greenview No. 16 2003a). Additionally, the MD of Greenview’s Land 
Use Bylaw No. 03-396 recognizes oil and gas exploration activities as an acceptable 
use of Crown land, subject to the necessary permits (MD of Greenview 2003b).

TABLE 5.1  Cont’d 

Environmental and 
Socio-Economic 

Elements Summary of Considerations 
General (cont’d) • Approximately 85% of the land base in MD of Greenview is Crown land that 

accommodates a variety of major economic activities including oil and gas, forestry, 
sand and gravel extraction, and agriculture (MD of Greenview 2003a). Given this 
substantial amount of provincially regulated land, a main objective of the MD of 
Greenview MDP is to cooperate with provincial government departments in the 
planning and development processes affecting Crown lands (MD of Greenview 2003a). 

• The Town of Grande Cache and the MD of Greenview agree to cooperate on matters 
of shared interest, and have adopted complementary goals and objectives for land use. 
The Grande Cache Intermunicipal Development Plan (IDP) has a policy to support 
natural resource extraction operations (MD of Greenview and Town of Grande 
Cache 2002). The IDP supports cooperation with government agencies on the use of 
Crown lands including AESRD, Alberta Transportation and Alberta Community 
Development (currently Alberta Culture and Tourism) (in regards to historical 
resources) (MD of Greenview and Town of Grande Cache 2002).  

• The nearest Indian Reserves (IRs) to the Project are the Sturgeon Lake Cree Nation 
IRs including IR No. 154, No. 154A and No. 154B (located between 87 and 97 km 
southeast of KP 0.0 and approximately 100 km northeast of the meter station). The 
most populated reserve is IR No. 154 (Government of Canada 2014a). 

• Recreational use of lands in the HORU RSA includes camping, hiking, canoeing/ 
kayaking, fishing, boating and ATV use. There are no conservation and recreation 
tourism areas or forest recreation areas in the HORU LSA and RSA (Government of 
Alberta 2012, AltaLIS 2008a). Given the Project location, very little Project interaction 
with local and regional recreational activities is expected. 

• The Project (i.e., pipeline route and meter station) cannot be viewed by a scenic 
highway or identified recreation use area. 

• The Project is not located in any metallic or industrial dispositions (Alberta 
Energy 2014a). 

• The Project is located within Forest Management Unit (FMU) G16 operated by 
Weyerhaeuser Company Limited (Weyerhaeuser) (Grande Prairie) under Forest 
Management Agreement (FMA) 6900016 (Weyerhaeuser 2011). The FMA currently 
has an approved Annual Allowable Cut (AAC) of approximately 2,278,000 m3 
coniferous timber and 1,478,000 m3 deciduous timber for the period from 2009 to 2018 
(Weyerhaeuser 2011). Weyerhaeuser has rights to most of the coniferous cut with the 
exception of a small portion (8,600 m3/year) allocated for the community timber 
program (Weyerhaeuser 2011). Weyerhaeuser has rights to 148,000 m3/year of the 
deciduous AAC while two other forest companies were granted rights to the remaining 
deciduous timber within the Weyerhaeuser FMU. For the period from 2009 to 2018, the 
remaining deciduous AAC is divided as follows: Tolko Forest Industries Ltd. - 80,000 
m3/year; and Ainsworth Lumber Company Ltd. - 1,199,000 m3/year 
(Weyerhaeuser 2011). 

• The following existing PNTs and deciduous timber license (DTL) related to Crown 
dispositions include:  
− PNT 10018, which is associated with University of Alberta Research Plots in 8-23-

68-7 W6M (KP 0.5 to KP 0.9); and  
− PNT 10022, which is associated with Ainsworth Lumber Company. Ltd. Superior 

Tree Candidate Site Selection #8037 in 9-22-67-7 W6M (KP 10.7 to KP 11.2).  
− DTL G910005, which is held by Ainsworth Lumber Company Ltd. (Alberta 

Energy 2014a). 
• The Project is located within one wildlife management units (WMUs): Cutbank WMU 

356 (AltaLIS 2012b). Open season for hunting in WMUs 356 takes place for periods of 
time between August 25 and December 20 (Government of Alberta 2014).

Elements Summary of Considerations 
General (cont’d) • In WMU 356, the general hunting season for antlered/antlerless white-tailed deer, 

antlered mule deer and antlered elk is September 17 to November 30 and August 25 to 
September 16 for archery only (Government of Alberta 2014). The general hunting 
season for antlered moose is September 24 to November 30 and August 25 to 
September 23 for archery only (Government of Alberta 2014). The general hunting 
season for antlerless elk is September 17 to December 20 and August 25 to 
September 16 for archery only (Government of Alberta 2014).  

• In WMU 356, there are a total of 96 registered guide outfitter permits 
(Heppner pers. comm.). 

Pipeline • The pipeline does not overlap or cross any Indian Reserves. However, it currently 
overlaps the asserted traditional territory boundaries of the Aseniwuche Winewak, Drift 
Pile, Enoch, Horse Lake and Sucker Creek First Nations as well as Kelly Lake Cree 
Nation and Treaty 8. The Métis Nation of Alberta Zones 4 and 6 are crossed from 
KP 0.0 to KP 6.6 and KP 6.6 to KP 32.3 respectively (Government of Canada 2014a). 

• The pipeline route lies within two active trapper boundaries from KP 0.0 to KP 27.6 and 
KP 27.6 to KP 32.3 (IHS Inc. 2012). 

• The pipeline route does not cross any rural or urban residential areas, agricultural 
areas, protected areas, lands under Parks Canada jurisdiction, or other ecological 
reserves or preserves (AltaLIS 2008b, 2012a). 

• There are no past or operating mines, active coal tenures or aggregate pits crossed by 
the pipeline route or located in the HORU LSA and HORU RSA (Alberta 
Energy 2014b,c, IHS Inc. 2011). 

• The nearest communities to the pipeline route include the Hamlet of Grovedale (14 km 
northeast of KP 0.0), the City of Grande Prairie (25 km northeast of KP 0.0), Town of 
Wembley (29 km northwest of KP 0.0) and the Town of Grand Cache (82 km south of 
KP 32.2) (AltaLIS 2014). The Town of Grande Cache and City of Grande Prairie 
provide full services (e.g., emergency and medical services) while the Hamlet of 
Grovedale and Town of Wembley provide partial services (e.g., community centre, 
parks) (City of Grande Prairie 2014, Discover the Peace 2014, Town of Grande 
Cache 2013a, Town of Wembley 2014).  

• There are 21 wells within approximately 1 km of either side of the proposed pipeline 
route center line, including 12 industrial wells, 6 for investigations, 1 domestic well and 
2 listed as unknown/other (AESRD 2014c). 

Meter Station • The nearest communities to the meter station include Town of Grand Cache (60 km 
southwest), the Hamlet of Landry Heights (60 km northwest), the Hamlet of Grovedale 
(72 km north), the Town of Wembley (75 km north) and the City of Grande Prairie 
(83 km northeast) (AltaLIS 2014). The Town of Grande Cache and City of Grande 
Prairie provide full services (e.g., emergency and medical services) while the Hamlet of 
Grovedale and Town of Wembley provide partial services (e.g., community centre, 
parks) (City of Grande Prairie 2014a, Discover the Peace 2014, Town of Grande 
Cache 2013a, Town of Wembley 2014). 

• There are 10 water wells within approximately 1.5 km of the proposed meter station, all 
of which are listed for industrial use (AESRD 2014c). 

Heritage Resources 
Spatial Boundary • The spatial boundaries of the Heritage Resources RSA for the Project comprise the 

area extending beyond the Footprint and are defined as an area of adjoining Borden 
Blocks intersected by the pipeline route (Borden and Duff 1952) (Figure 6.9).

Elements Summary of Considerations 
General • A portion of the proposed pipeline route located in Borden Blocks within the Heritage 

Resources RSA is listed as having Historical Resource Values (HRVs) (Alberta Culture 
and Tourism 2014), according to the results of a file search which found two previously 
recorded archaeological sites within the Heritage Resources RSA. Previously recorded 
archaeological site GfQr-1 (HRV 0) is located approximately 3.0 km northwest of KP 0, 
while previously recorded archaeological site GfQr-2 (HRV 4) is located approximately 
1.3 km west of KP 8. Sites GfQr-1 and GfQr-2 are located outside the Project Footprint 
and will not be affected by Project activities. 

• Results of a site file search found no previously recorded archaeological sites, historic 
structures or palaeontological sites to be located within the Project Footprint, including 
the proposed meter station site. 

• Desktop review has determined that the potential for undiscovered heritage resources 
exists at any point along the proposed pipeline route, though the potential for intact 
surface or subsurface archaeological deposits is higher in areas of pronounced 
topographical relief, on landforms associated with drainage crossings, and in lands 
which have not been disturbed by previous forestry, oil and gas, road building or other 
infrastructure projects. Areas of the proposed pipeline route that exhibit minimal 
existing disturbance or the presence of microtopgraphical relief and thus potential for 
intact archaeological sites include: KP 0 to KP 5; KP 1.5 to KP 2; KP 4.3 to KP 5.3; 
KP 7.4 to KP 9.4; KP 11.7 to KP 12.2; KP 24 to KP 25, and; KP 28.5 to KP 30. A total 
of eleven flat and elevated landforms with archaeological potential were identified 
within the Project Footprint, all of which were assessed during the 2014 HRIA for the 
Project. Undisturbed areas are characterized by mixed forests of aspen, spruce and 
pine on gently to moderately sloping terrain, with microtopographical features of 
archaeological potential prevalent near drainage crossings. 

• The proposed meter station site is located on low-lying, featureless and previously 
disturbed terrain with low potential for archaeological resources. No heritage resources 
were discovered at the proposed meter station site during HRIA fieldwork conducted in 
October 2014. 

• An HRIA was conducted on June 24 to 26, August 4 to 9 and October 10 to 11 2014 
under snow-free and frost-free conditions. During the HRIA, a total of 183 shovel tests 
were excavated under Archaeological Research Permit 14-106, with one newly 
discovered archaeological site (GfQr-3) within the Project Footprint and no historic sites 
identified within the Project footprint. Archaeological site GfQr-3 is an isolated pre-
contact, subsurface lithic find consisting of a single tertiary chert flake. As a result, 
GfQr-3 will not be affected by Project activities. See Section 6.2.13 for further 
information and results. A final report outlining the results of the HRIA will be compiled 
and recommendations for HRA clearance will be made based on these results. 

• An overview assessment for palaeontological resources by a qualified Palaeontologist 
has determined the potential for undiscovered palaeontological resources within the 
Project Footprint to be low. As a result, an HRIA for palaeontological resources was not 
conducted for the Project. 

• Heritage resources TEK for the Project was collected with participating community 
members from Aseniwuche Winewak Nation of Canada, Horse Lake First Nation, Kelly 
Lake Cree Nation, Kelly Lake Métis Settlement Society and the Métis Nation of Alberta 
Association Region 6. A campsite dating to circa 40 years ago was identified within the 
Project Footprint 3.3 m southeast of KP 16.1, along with a potential culturally-modified 
tree of similar age, thought to be a trap line marker. Neither of the two identified sites 
are protected under the HRA. No specific concerns regarding heritage resources were 
raised by participants during the field studies, and no mitigation is required for these 
sites.

Elements Summary of Considerations 
Traditional Land and Resource Use 
Spatial Boundary • The TLRU LSA encompasses and extends beyond the Footprint to include the LSA 

boundaries of water quality and quantity, fish and fish habitat, wetlands, vegetation, 
wildlife and wildlife habitat, and heritage resources, since TLU is dependent on these 
resources. Accordingly, the LSA is defined as a 2 km wide band centred on the 
proposed pipeline route centre line (i.e., 1 km on both sides of the centre line) and a 
1 km radius centred in the perimeter of the meter station to encompass the boundaries 
of the wildlife and wildlife habitat and vegetation boundaries around the meter station. 
The TLRU RSA is defined as a 30 km wide band centred on the proposed pipeline 
route centre line (i.e., 15 km on both sides of the centre line) and includes the RSA 
boundaries of water quality and quantity, fish and fish habitat, wetlands, vegetation, 
wildlife and wildlife habitat, and heritage resources to include the meter station, where 
applicable (Figure 6.10). 

General • NGTL determined the Aboriginal communities potentially affected by the Project 
through a combination of desktop research, NGTL’s own operating experience in the 
region and NGTL’s established contacts with Aboriginal communities.  

• Although no Indian Reserves are crossed by the Project, there are Aboriginal 
communities located in proximity to the proposed pipeline route. These communities 
are Aseniwuche Winewak Nation, Horse Lake First Nation, Grande Cache Métis Local 
#1994, Grande Prairie Métis Local #1990, Kelly Lake Cree Nation, Kelly Lake First 
Nation, Kelly Lake Métis, Nose Cree Settlement, Sturgeon Lake Cree, Métis Nation of 
Alberta Association 4 and Métis Nation of Alberta Association Region 6. 

• A TK Report was prepared by TERA which incorporates the results of engagement and 
TLU studies conducted with participating Aboriginal communities (Appendix 8). 

• Since February 2014, NGTL has engaged with potentially affected Aboriginal 
communities and interested communities were invited to participate in TLU studies for 
the Project. NGTL provides funding to assist Aboriginal communities with independent 
(i.e., third-party) TLU studies. Sturgeon Lake Cree Nation, Grande Cache Métis Local 
#1994, Grande Prairie Métis Local #1990, Métis Nation of Alberta Association Region 4 
and Métis Nation of Alberta Association Region 6 are currently conducting third-party 
TLU studies and the results will be provided to the NEB in a supplemental filing in 
Q1, 2015. Kelly Lake Cree Nation is currently conducting an independent TLU study 
and results will be provided to the NEB in a supplemental filing, also in Q1 2015. 
Aseniwuche Winewak Nation of Canada, Horse Lake First Nation and Nose Creek 
Settlement Society have conducted independent TLU studies and the results have 
been provided in the TK Report (Appendix 8). Kelly Lake First Nation and Kelly Lake 
Métis Settlement Society have elected not to conduct TLU studies. 

• The Aboriginal communities listed above have historically used or presently use Crown 
lands in the region to maintain a traditional lifestyle. 

• Horse Lake First Nation have identified eight plant gathering sites, and two hunting 
sites within the proposed Project ROW, however have requested no site specific 
mitigation. Additional information regarding descriptions and locations of known TLU 
sites within the TLRU RSA is provided in Appendix 8. 

Social and Cultural Well-Being 
Spatial Boundary • The spatial boundaries of social and cultural well-being are defined by the Community 

LSA and Community RSA. The Community LSA consists of the boundaries of 
communities where it can reasonably be expected that direct effects from the Project 
would occur (e.g., the City of Grande Prairie and the Town of Grande Cache and 
Sturgeon Lake Cree Nation). The Community RSA consists of the boundaries of the 
MD of Greenview where it can be reasonably be expected that direct and indirect 
effects, extending beyond the Community LSA, would occur (Figure 6.11).

TABLE 5.1  Cont’d 

Environmental and 
Socio-Economic 

Elements Summary of Considerations 
General • The MD of Greenview MDP and Land Use Bylaw do not provide specific management 

direction pertaining to social and cultural well-being. 
• In 2011, the MD of Greenview had a total population of 5,330, compared with 5,464 in 

2006. In 2011, 66.7% of the population was between 15 and 64 years old and the 
median age was 40.5 (Statistics Canada 2012a). Of the total population, the portion of 
the population identifying as Aboriginal consisted of 630. The MD had a labour force of 
2,940 including 1,705 males and 1,235 females (Statistics Canada 2013a). Census 
data for the MD of Greenview includes data for the Hamlet of Grovedale and the 
Hamlet of Landry Heights. 

• In 2011 Grande Prairie had a total population of 55,032, compared with 47,107 in 2006. 
In 2011, 72.6% of the population was between 15 and 64 years old and the median 
age was 30.3 (Statistics Canada 2012b). Of the total population, the portion of the 
population identifying as Aboriginal consisted of 5,290. The city had a labour force of 
34,105, including 18,920 males and 15,185 females (Statistics Canada 2013b). 

• In 2011, the Town of Grande Cache had a total population of 4,319, compared with 
3,783 in 2006. In 2011, approximately 70.1% of the population was between 15 and 64 
years old and the median age was 33.6 (Statistics Canada 2012c). Of the total 
population, the portion of the population identifying as Aboriginal consisted of 500. The 
Town of Grande Cache had a labour force of 2,470 individuals including 1,480 males 
and 990 females (Statistics Canada 2013c).  

• In 2011, the Town of Wembley had a total population of 1,383, compared with 1,443 in 
2006. In 2011, approximately 69% of the population was between 15 and 64 years old 
and the median age was 31.4 (Statistics Canada 2012d). Of the total population, the 
portion of the population identifying as Aboriginal consisted of 160. The Town of 
Wembley had a labour force of 880 individuals including 530 males and 350 females 
(Statistics Canada 2013d).  

• As of July 2014, the total registered population of Sturgeon Lake Cree Nation was 
3,131 with 1,420 members living on reserve. In 2011, the population was 1,190 which 
was consistent to the 2006 population. The median age of the population in 2011 was 
34.6. Main industries in Sturgeon Lake Cree Nation are manufacturing, construction 
agriculture, and resource based (AANDC 2014).  

• Construction of the Project will involve a workforce of up to 450 workers over a period 
of 12 to 16 weeks. This incremental change to the local population is unlikely to place 
any undue pressures on municipal services, emergency services or local 
accommodations (see Infrastructure and Services element of this table) during the 
construction period. 

• The ongoing operation and maintenance of the Project will be sporadic and limited in 
scope. In addition, such activities will be consistent with other land uses and industrial 
activities being conducted in the area. 

Human Health 
Spatial Boundary  • The Human Health element uses the spatial boundaries of the HORU LSA and HORU 

RSA (Figure 6.8).

TABLE 5.1  Cont’d 

Environmental and 
Socio-Economic 

Elements Summary of Considerations 
General • The environmental elements associated with the Project that may be related to human 

health include physical and meteorological environment, soil and soil productivity, 
water quality, air emissions, acoustic environment, fish and fish habitat, and wildlife and 
wildlife habitat. Socio-economic elements that may be related to human health include 
HORU, TLRU, social and cultural well-being, and infrastructure and services. 
Information pertaining to these elements is presented in this table; information related 
to health services is presented under the Infrastructure and Services section in this 
table. The Project-related activities, nuisance emissions and environmental changes 
that could potentially be sources of adverse human health effects, potential human 
receptors of these effects and mitigation pertaining to human health are discussed in 
Section 6.2.16. 

• No public concerns related to the Project regarding human health effects have been 
raised through the stakeholder engagement process (Section 3.0). 

• The MD of Greenview’s MDP and Land Use Bylaw do not provide specific 
management direction pertaining to human health. 

• During Project construction and operations, a temporary increase in airborne emissions 
and noise levels is anticipated. 

• The nearest potential human receptor to the Project is a trapper’s cabin located in 
SE 14-68-7 W6M, approximately 550 m west from KP 2.7. 

Infrastructure and Services 
Spatial Boundaries • Infrastructure and Services uses the spatial boundaries of the Community LSA and 

Community RSA (Figure 6.11).  
General  • The MD of Greenview’s MDP and Land Use Bylaw do not provide specific 

management direction pertaining to infrastructure and services. 
• Access to the Project is via Highway 40 and various existing industrial and resource 

roads. 
• In 2012, an automated traffic recorder (ATR) located along Highway 40 just north of the 

Smoky River Mine Access Road (located at 15-58-8 W6M) recorded an average 
annual daily traffic (AADT) volume of 1,010 vehicles, increasing from 760 vehicles 
in 2003 (Alberta Transportation 2013). There is an ATR located just east of the Town of 
Grande Cache, 25.1 km west of the intersection of Highway 40 and Forestry Trunk 
Road. The AADT volume at this ATR has varied only slightly since it was installed in 
2005; it recorded an AADT of 1,500 vehicles in 2005, which increased to 1,560 
vehicles in 2012 (Alberta Transportation 2013). 

• The nearest community airport is located in the Town of Grande Cache and the nearest 
Transport Canada certified regional/passenger airport is located in Grande Prairie 
(Aviation Strategy Action Group 2003). 

• Natural gas and electricity in the vicinity of the Project is provided by ATCO (ATCO 
Group 2013). 

• The City of Grande Prairie and the Town of Grande Cache are the nearest major centres 
to the Project, and both provide all major services (City of Grande Prairie 2014, Town of 
Grande Cache 2013a). Other nearby communities with partial services include the 
Hamlet of Grovedale and Town of Wembley, which provide services such as groceries, 
gas and post offices (Discover the Peace 2014, Town of Wembley 2014). Construction 
crews for the pipeline and meter station are expected to use accommodations in Grande 
Prairie for the duration of Project activities (see Table 2.3). 

• The Grovedale Landfill/Transfer Station is the nearest solid waste facility to the Project 
and is located approximately 50 km east of KP 0.0, providing both solid waste and 
recycling services (MD of Greenview 2013b). The landfill for the Town of Grande 
Cache is closer than the Grovedale Landfill/Transfer Station, however, as of April 2007, 
it no longer accepts waste from outside the town limits (Town of Grande Cache 2013b).

TABLE 5.1  Cont’d 

Environmental and 
Socio-Economic 

Elements Summary of Considerations 
General (cont’d) • The Grande Cache Community Health Complex is the closest health services facility to 

the Project construction site. It provides 24-hour acute and continuing care as well as 
emergency health services (Alberta Health Services 2013). However, crews are 
expected to use accommodations in the City of Grande Prairie where health services 
include emergency, continuing and long-term care, hospitals, mental health and 
addiction counselling and x-ray services (Alberta Health Services 2013). During 
construction activities, field medical services will be available for standard first aid at 
the Project site. 

• The nearest fire station, operated by the MD of Greenview, is located in the Hamlet of 
Grovedale, however, through a joint agreement, the MD of Greenview also has 
emergency access to the fire department in the Town of Grande Cache (MD of 
Greenview 2013c). The MD of Greenview maintains a contract with the enforcement 
division of the County of Grande Prairie, through which RCMP Enforcement Services 
are augmented through the use of Peace Officers who provide for enforcement of the 
Traffic Safety Act, in addition to any and all other duties as allowed under the Peace 
Officer Act (MD of Greenview 2013d).  

• Accommodation options in the Community LSA include campgrounds, hotels/motels, 
and Bed and Breakfasts (World Web Technologies Inc. 2014) 

• The Town of Grande Cache draws its domestic drinking water from Grande Cache 
Lake and Victor Lake (MD of Greenview and Town of Grande Cache 2002). 

Navigation and Navigation Safety 
Spatial Boundary • The pipeline route crosses 12 watercourses. Bald Mountain Creek (WC1 [KP 4.67]), 

and 11 unnamed tributaries to Bald Mountain Creek (at KP 4.9 [WC2], KP 8.2 [WC3], 
KP 8.7 [WC4], KP 10.0 [WC5], KP 12.0 [WC6], KP 14.3 [WC7], KP 16.1 [WC8], 
KP 16.2 [WC9], KP 21.9 [WC10], KP 22.9 [WC11] and KP 23.4 [WC12]) (Natural 
Resources Canada 2007-2011). There are no watercourses within 30 m of the meter 
station.  

General • The potential for a watercourse to be considered navigable was based on criteria such 
as channel width, water depth, and the presence of obstructions. Of the 12 
watercourses, 4 were determined to be navigable (WC1, WC8, WC9, WC11), however, 
Project activities will not be located in, on, over, under, through or across a navigable 
waterway when water is flowing (i.e., not seasonally dry or frozen); therefore, detailed 
information is not warranted as per Table A-1 of the Filing Manual (NEB 2014a). 

• The types of activities and use on watercourses crossed by the pipeline route can 
include activities such as fishing or canoeing. Vessels and craft used on watercourses 
crossed by the pipeline route can include boats, canoes or kayaks.  

Employment and Economy 
Spatial Boundary • Employment and Economy uses the spatial boundaries of the Community LSA and 

Community RSA.  
General • The MD of Greenview MDP and Land Use Bylaw do not provide specific management 

direction pertaining to employment and economy. 
• In 2011, approximately 40% of residents in the MD of Greenview aged 15 and over had 

a college or other non-university certificate or diploma, approximately 24% had a high 
school diploma or equivalent and approximately 36% had no certificate, diploma or 
degree. The participation, employment and unemployment rates were 71%, 66% and 
7%, respectively, and the most common industries in which residents were employed 
included: agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting; construction; and mining, quarrying, 
and oil and gas extraction (Statistics Canada 2013a). Employment and economy 
characteristics from Statistics Canada for the MD of Greenview include data for the 
Hamlet of Grovedale and the Hamlet of Landry Heights.

TABLE 5.1  Cont’d 

Environmental and 
Socio-Economic 

Elements Summary of Considerations 
General (cont’d) • In 2011, approximately 37% of residents in Grande Prairie aged 15 and over had a 

post-secondary certificate, diploma or degree, approximately 23% had a high school 
diploma or equivalent and approximately 17% had no certificate, diploma or degree. 
The participation, employment and unemployment rates were 80%, 75% and 6%, 
respectively, and the most common industries in which residents were employed 
included: mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction; retail trade; and health care and 
social assistance (Statistics Canada 2013b). 

• In 2011, approximately 38% of residents in the Town of Grande Cache aged 15 and 
over had a post-secondary certificate, diploma or degree, 25% had a high school 
diploma or equivalent and 16% had no certificate, diploma or degree. The participation, 
employment and unemployment rates were 74%, 72% and 3%, respectively, and the 
most common industries in which residents were employed included: trades, transport 
and equipment operators and related occupations; occupations in education, law and 
social, community and government services; and sales and service occupations 
(Statistics Canada 2013c). 

• In 2011, approximately 38% of residents in the Town of Wembley aged 15 years and 
over had a post-secondary certificate, diploma or degree, 31% had a high school 
diploma or equivalent and 31% had no certificate, diploma or degree. The participation, 
employment and unemployment rates were 81%, 78% and 4%, respectively, and the 
most common industries in which residents were employed included: trades, transport 
and equipment operators and related occupations; sales and service occupations; and 
business finance and administration operations (Statistics Canada 2013d).  

• In 2011, approximately 15% (120 out of 800 individuals) of the population of Sturgeon 
Lake Cree Nation aged 15 years and over had obtained a trades/apprenticeship or 
other non-university certificate, 18% had a high school diploma or equivalent only and 
66% had no certificate, a diploma or degree. In 2011, the participation, employment 
and unemployment rates were 49%, 44% and 10% respectively and the most common 
occupations were management and primary industry occupations (e.g., logging, 
forestry, oil and gas) (AANDC 2012).  

• Given the scope of the Project, a detailed economic analysis was not deemed 
warranted for the Project. 

• NGTL and its contractors focus on providing meaningful economic opportunities to 
individuals and established Aboriginal-owned businesses, including subcontracting and 
employment opportunities in both the new construction and the maintenance of existing 
facilities.  

• Qualified Aboriginal businesses within the Community RSA (Band-owned and private 
businesses) will be given the opportunity to compete on an equal basis for available 
subcontracting work, provided they have the safety, financial and business capacity to 
take part in the Project. On occasion, NGTL or NGTL's prime contractors may 
negotiate a specific contract with an Aboriginal business depending on the number of 
businesses in the community that may provide that specific service, their work history 
with the industry and the number of people they employ from the local community.  

• NGTL has been working collaboratively with Aseniwuche Winewak Nation of Canada, 
Métis Nation of Alberta, Region 4, Local 1994 (Grande Cache), Nose Creek 
Community, Kelly Lake Cree Nation, Horse Lake First Nation and Kelly Lake Métis 
Settlement Society to identify individuals and businesses that could potentially provide 
services to the Project. Where training is necessary in order for communities to take 
advantage of opportunities, NGTL, the prime contractor and the community will 
participate in the development and implementation of the necessary training. 

• Notice of potential employment opportunities is given to the business community and 
its members through newspaper ads and community meetings. During the community 
meetings, an NGTL contracting representative is made available to explain the 
opportunities and process. NGTL may consider splitting or separating larger contracts 
in suitable work packages to accommodate more involvement without compromising 
safety. Where there are multiple businesses competing for similar contracts, a 
contractor meeting will be held, and a competitive bidding and tendering process will be 
introduced. This will ensure fairness and transparency for all parties.
